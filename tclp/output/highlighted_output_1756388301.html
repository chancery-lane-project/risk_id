Our approach to scheduling, monitoring, and managing activities:By using[Redacted]for the Performance Management Reporting you will benefit from an integrated tool for defining tasks and activities, planning and phasing, scheduling with dependencies, resource allocation as well as feedback surveys, engagement and background information.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>This significantly reduces time processing activities, for example with automated update reminders.</span><br><br>Planning and delivery approach across phases:In our experience, this type of programme continues to evolve as you and the Vanguards test, learn and adapt to delivery in practice.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>Our DfE colleagues have reflected on how time trying to perfect the plan on paper can be wasted if not learning from practical experience.</span><br><br>Phase 1 – strategic planning and service design:The initial focus is on establishing ways of working, personal connections, and governance with DWP/DHSC colleagues, creating a shared understanding across us that can drive collaboration between the national/regional/local levels.<br><br>This will build trust and momentum within the WorkWell Programme.<br><br>The focus then shifts to designing and conducting the individual Vanguard maturity assessment, which will shape how the Programme provides support and demonstrates flexibility in how services are delivered Phase 2 – service implementation and delivery:We will run Phases 2 and 3 concurrently to support service delivery, learning and dissemination.<br><br>Our rationale is that this supports fast, effective, and shared learning, both of what is working but also what isn’t working.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>It also sets up rapid review cycles, iterative development the toolkit and potential for[Redacted].</span><br><br>Our proposed delivery model of relationship managers(RMs)supporting thematically grouped Vanguards means that the Programme resources can be more flexible in response to different starting points, emerging challenges, and growing maturity over time.<br><br>Phase 3 – lessons learnt, toolkit development, and final report:By running Phase 3 concurrently to Phase 2, our approach is more iterative and dynamic, which we believe will greatly enhance the learning element of the Programme and therefore impact in the medium- longer term.<br><br>We will deliver a draft WorkWell toolkit every quarter starting from a version in October 2024, with six iterations in total.<br><br>This will ensure learning and dissemination starts from the outset, lessons are shared early, and shared learning is expected.<br><br>Escalation routes:[Redacted]is our dedicated

officer.<br><br>Right from the first week of mobilisation it will be important for us all to form as a team, ensuring that we are explicit on the expectations, behaviours and accountabilities that will act as a bedrock for strong, productive relationships.<br><br>The formal governance described in the ITT documentation is appropriate for this type of programme with a fortnightly performance meeting and quarterly strategic review meeting.<br><br>In addition, we recommend a prudent use of scheduled stand-ups and a weekly programme board, at least during phase 1, to ensure we speak frequently to manage the work and are quick to adapt and respond during the formative set-up stage.<br><br>We would also suggest the programme should formally report to the DWP Programme Board every six months, linked to key phase Risk management:Drawing on our experience of delivering similar programmes, on page 4 of the Supplier Delivery Plan we present what we consider to be the main risks and
