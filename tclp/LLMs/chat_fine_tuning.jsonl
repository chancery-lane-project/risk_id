KPI [1: Sustainability] 1.1 Description This KPI [1: Sustainability] sets out the actions that the Contractor must take to meet the Employer's [[net zero/ decarbonisation/ sustainability] targets/ goals] when delivering the Task Orders. 1.2 Objective To improve the sustainability of activities on Task Orders so that they align with the Employer's [net zero/ decarbonisation/ sustainability] targets set out in Schedule ● [ Not provided and bespoke to each Employer. Include the Employer's net zero or other decarbonisation targets into a schedule ]. 1.3 Critical success factors 1.3.1 Regular reporting [in line with the Reporting Standards]. 1.3.2 The Contractor's environmental management system shall be in line with ISO 14001. [ For information on ISO 14001, see ISO 14001 and related standards — Environmental management . ] 1.4 Measure KPI [1: Sustainability] is made up of six objectives (the Objectives ): 1.4.1 Percentage of aggregates used in construction works by weight that are from secondary/recycled sources (including materials generated on-site) for Objective 1 (recycled aggregates); 1.4.2 Percentage of construction wastes produced from construction works that are sent for disposal to landfill for Objective 2 (wastes); 1.4.3 m3 per [£]million construction spend for Objective 3 (reduction in water consumption); 1.4.4 Percentage of the carbon footprint for Objective 4 (reduction in carbon footprint); 1.4.5 Percentage of the monetary value of all materials used in the programme that are certified by the ethical stone register or at ‘bronze' or above by the Cradle to Cradle certification scheme for Objective 5 (optimisation of resource use); and 1.4.6 Percentage of environmental net gain delivered by the construction works for Objective 6 (environmental net gain). 1.5 Owner and reporting responsibility Contractor[/ Supplier]. 1.6 Methodology 1.6.1 Objective 1 (recycled aggregates) This objective relates to the difference in the amount of secondary/ recycled aggregates used in the construction works under the Task Orders within the relevant Financial Year compared to the total amount of primary aggregates used (measured by weight in tonnes) in the same. For the purposes of this objective, types of aggregates include [rock, gravel, shingle, sand, topsoil, subsoil and clay]. Secondary materials include off-specification materials or industrial by-products. This could be generated on-site or off-site. It does not include: specifically designed cut and fill operations; or rock armour from quarries. Recycled aggregates mean aggregates that have gone through a recovery process (for example, concrete crushing for hardcore or screening to separate soil from rock). This could be generated on-site or off-site. The winning of material on-site (such as through borrow pits) for use in the construction stage should not be included in the figures reported. 1.6.2 Objective 2 (wastes) This objective relates to the difference in the amount of wastes arising from the construction works under the Task Orders within the relevant Financial Year that are sent to landfill compared to the total amount generated (measured by weight in tonnes) from the same. This should be expressed as a percentage excluding hazardous wastes as defined in [ refer to a schedule to the contract where hazardous wastes are defined ]. The hazardous wastes should not be taken into account in the performance report. For the purpose of measuring Objective 2, the total amount of construction waste should include all wastes arising from a construction project including waste materials that are generated and reused on site. Excavation materials that are produced and reused on-site are not regarded as waste. Disposal in a landfill means deposit of the wastes within a landfill cell (including use as a daily cover material). Use of the material for engineering works (for example, for a clay cap) or as final restoration soils would be reused rather than disposal. 1.6.3 Objective 3 (reduction in water consumption) This objective relates to the use of water on site from water mains, bowsers and abstractions. For example, the reuse of water from concrete washouts and rainwater harvesting are not counted in the target as this is re-use and to be encouraged. For the purpose of measuring Objective 3, it excludes the use of water in products delivered to site (for example, precast concrete units) but includes any used for mixing concrete on site for example. Water consumption information must be gathered from meters for mains water and bowsers must be manually recorded in addition to any abstractions. The Carbon Calculator* must be used to record this information. * 1.6.4 Objective 4 (reduction in whole life carbon footprint) This objective relates to the difference between the whole life carbon footprint reported as part of the [RIBA Stage 3 or Stage 4] approval for the project compared to the carbon footprint reported via the Carbon Calculator at Task Completion. This should be expressed as a percentage. 1.6.5 Objective 5 (optimisation of resource use) This objective relates to the difference in the monetary value of all materials used arising from the Task Orders within the relevant Financial Year that are certified by the ethical stone register, or at ‘bronze' or above by the Cradle to Cradle certification scheme, compared to the total amount of materials used (measured by cost in [£]) from the same. This should be expressed as a percentage. Included in this calculation are: (a) Materials avoided by re-use for their same purpose. Excluded from this calculation are: (b) Zero and/or low carbon cements; and (c) Hardwood and hardwood substitutes. 1.6.6 Objective 6 (environmental net gain) This objective relates to the difference in the amount of environmental gain arising from the construction works under the Task Orders within the relevant Financial Year compared to the total environmental loss from the same. This should be expressed as a percentage. 1.7 Formula for calculating/ measuring performance 1.7.1 The Contractor shall collect information on each Objective on every Task Order that requires construction. The Contractor shall report the information to the Employer [ insert time/ dates for reporting from the Reporting Standards ]. 1.7.2 A raw score for each Objective (the Raw Score ) is established using the matrices below. (a) Objective 1 (recycled aggregates) Contractor's performance in respect of Objective 1: ●% more than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● Performance target = a Raw Score of ● Less than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● (b) Objective 2 (wastes) Contractor's performance in respect of Objective 2: ●% more than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● Performance target = a Raw Score of ● Less than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● (c) Objective 3 (reduction in water consumption) Contractor's performance in respect of Objective 3: ●% more than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● Performance target = a Raw Score of ● Less than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● (d) Objective 4 (reduction in carbon footprint) Contractor's performance in respect of Objective 4: ●% more than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● Performance target = a Raw Score of ● Less than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● (e) Objective 5 (optimisation of resource use) Contractor's performance in respect of Objective 5: ●% more than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● Performance target = a Raw Score of ● Less than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● (f) Objective 6 (environmental net gain) Contractor's performance in respect of Objective 6: ●% more than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● Performance target = a Raw Score of ● Less than the performance target = a Raw Score of ● 1.7.3 Each Objective has a weighting Objective 1 (recycled aggregates) = ● Objective 2 (wastes) = ● Objective 3 (reduction in water consumption) = ● Objective 4 (reduction in whole life carbon) = ● Objective 5 (optimisation of resource use) = ● Objective 6 (environmental net gain) = ● 1.7.4 The Raw Score for each component is combined to generate the Base KPI Score using the following formula: Base KPI Score=∑((Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective● ) + (Raw Score Objective ●). 1.7.5 For Financial Year ●/●, [Objective 5 (optimisation of resource use) and Objective 6 (environmental net gain)] will not be in operation. The other four Objectives will be weighted as follows: Objective 1 (recycled aggregates) = ● Objective 2 (wastes) = ● Objective 3 (reduction in water consumption) = ● Objective 4 (reduction in whole life carbon) = ● This is on the basis that the measurement methodology for the optimisation of resource use and environmental net gain is developed in [Financial Year ●/●], presented and approved by [the Employer] such that it can be implemented with effect from [the next Financial Year]. If this is not achieved due to matters outwith the Contractor's control then the weightings for Financial Year ●/● will continue to apply. 1.7.6 Where the delay or failure to implement [Objective 5 and/or Objective 6] is due to the default of the Contractor then a Raw Score of zero will be awarded for [Objective 5 and/or Objective 6] for each Financial Year that it remains inoperative. Under these circumstances, the Base KPI Score shall be calculated as follows: Base KPI Score=∑((Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective ●) + (Raw Score Objective● ) + (Raw Score Objective ●). 1.8 Source of data 1.8.1 Environment management system under ISO 14001; 1.8.2 Carbon Calculator at Schedule ●; 1.8.3 [ insert additional sources of data and records ]. 1.9 Evidence required A completed sustainability scorecard [in the form and content set out in Schedule ●]. 1.10 Performance target The performance target ( Performance Target ) for each Objective is set out below: 1.10.1 ● of aggregates used in construction works by weight are from secondary/ recycled sources (including materials generated on-site). 1.10.2 ● of construction wastes produced from construction works are sent for disposal to landfill. 1.10.3 ● per ● million construction spend. 1.10.4 Reduction of the Contractor's carbon footprint by ● from the predicted total of [RIBA Stage 3 or Stage 4] approval to the actual at Task Completion. 1.10.5 ● of monetary value of materials that are certified by the ethical stone register or at ‘bronze' or above the Cradle to Cradle certification scheme. 1.10.6 ● environmental net gain from the construction works. 1.11 Adjustments in performance targets The performance target for each Objective shall be adjusted as below: 1.11.1 Objective 1 will increase by ● every year. 1.11.2 Objective 2 will decrease by ● every year. 1.11.3 Objective 3 will decrease by ● cubic metres every ● year. 1.11.4 Objective 4 will increase by ● every year. 1.11.5 Objective 5 will increase by ● every year, beginning from the first year in operation. 1.11.6 Objective 6 will increase by ● every year, beginning from the first year in operation. 1.12 Achieving or failing to meet performance targets 1.12.1 If the Performance Target of any of the Objectives is not achieved, it shall be considered a Performance Failure. 1.12.2 If the Contractor fails to achieve any of the Employer's Performance Targets, the Employer may appoint a third party to carry out the said services (s/c X ‘Task Orders – Third Party to Provide Services') and the Contractor shall indemnify the Employer against the additional costs of doing so. 2 Enterprise Delivery Mechanisms (EDMs) Sustainability Enterprise Delivery Measures within Construction Works Task Orders . Tessa's Clause adds contractual clauses into construction works tasks orders that explicitly address climate change-related temperature increase and deconstruction for reuse (circular economy) in their appraisal and design. Tessa's Clause facilitates and encourages contractors/ suppliers to work in ways that: improve resilience and respond to the climate emergency through appraisal and design; embed circular economy using certified circular materials and considering deconstruction in design; enhance the environment; and increase social value. It does this by establishing metrics (i.e. EDMs) that incentivise innovation and lead to practices that improve sustainability. The assessment criteria drive improvement in environmental and sustainability outcomes. Note that EDMs are separate from KPIs, which report on performance rather than drive it. ] [END]"}]}

Commit counterparties to decarbonisation Use supply contracts to require counterparties to implement decarbonisation measures that align with the organisation's own climate strategy and objectives. Best practice is for contract parties to reflect climate obligations in their own value chain. This sets emissions-reduction targets as part of all contracts, helping the organisation meet its own targets. Example wording [Party B] shall do all of the following: set public emissions-reduction targets [that are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative ] within [3 months] of entering into this agreement develop and immediately implement a transition plan within [6 months] of entering into this agreement. The transition plan will be: created with the assistance of and agreed with [Party A] reviewed and updated regularly with [Party A] measure, calculate and report on its scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions and progress towards achieving emissions-reductions targets publicly [and annually] include a copy of this clause in all of its [third party contracts/ subcontracts/ supply chain agreements].

This: aligns with [Party A]'s emissions-reduction targets contained in its transition plan is consistent with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Include employee training in contracts Use supply contracts to require counterparties to provide training for employees and contractors. Training should extend to the organisation's decarbonisation strategy and objectives so that the counterparties' employees know what is expected of them in fulfilling the contract terms. This will help to: empower individuals to participate and actively engage in the decarbonisation objectives in the contract enhance climate and carbon literacy along the value chain, helping individuals make better and more informed decisions promote a climate-conscious culture that improves the quality of climate-related policies, and supports their implementation.

Make climate considerations part of the commercial rationale Obtain board approval on the climate terms of a contract at the earliest opportunity. For example, set a limit to greenhouse gas emissions associated with a contract. Read our guide Factor climate considerations into board decisions . Climate issues are more likely to be included in the final contract that governs a transaction if they are raised early in commercial discussions and contract negotiations. Collaborate early with counterparties and stakeholders To embed meaningful climate action in contracts requires support from counterparties, suppliers and other stakeholders. Engage early with these actors to establish clarity on their climate ambitions and expectations in commercial dealings. Collaborate with them before entering into a specific transaction. This helps to embed meaningful decarbonisation into contracts, rather than attempting to add climate as an after-thought. Commit to climate considerations in pre-contract documents Embed climate considerations into pre-contract documents, such as heads of terms, non-disclosure agreements, and requests for proposals. This formalises climate considerations in the commercial purpose of a transaction. Pre-contract documents set the tone and expectations for the transactions. Use these to raise the profile of climate considerations in future negotiations, including: transaction financing design and materials specifications team appointments the main contracts governing the transaction.

Use preambles to frame the intention of the parties Use preambles in pre-contract documents (like heads of terms) and the contracts governing the transaction to make clear the parties' climate ambitions for the contract. Preambles, or recitals, explain the context, commercial rationale and intentions of the parties entering the contract. Preambles are non-operative and not binding.

The decarbonisation strategy should include: a statement detailing the organisation's challenges in reducing emissions an overarching solution explaining how the organisation will overcome those challenges a plan (which can be the transition plan ) to implement the solution. Example wording The board members will act in good faith to: promote the best interests of [the Company] ensure that the business is conducted and developed in accordance with good business practice ensure that [the Company] adopts a business plan that: preserves the value of the shareholders' capital as invested in [the Company] implements [the Company]'s transition plan achieves [the Company]'s emissions-reduction targets. The board shall: adopt [the Company]'s transition plan designate a member of the board to be the chief sustainability officer (CSO). The board shall provide the minutes of the meeting to the shareholders detailing the transition plan as soon as reasonably possible. Independent of each formal board meeting, the board shall review and evaluate the impact of [the Company]'s emissions-reduction targets and transition plan on a quarterly basis. The board shall consider: [the Company]'s carbon footprint at the date of the meeting [the Company]'s progress in achieving its current emissions-reduction targets and transition plan whether any modifications should be made to the emissions-reduction targets and transition plan. The board shall provide minutes of such meetings to the shareholders. Incorporate climate into board minutes precedents Including climate clauses into the precedents for board minutes ensures all board decisions automatically consider related climate issues. Board decisions that factor in climate can then be cascaded to commercial decision-makers to align the company with its transition plan . Ensure board decisions use a framework that includes the company's end-to-end value chain to assess: the impact of a decision on the climate (that is, the emissions made, including the effect of the decision on climate targets) the impact of the climate on the company (particularly the financial risks). This is known as a double-materiality framework. When making decisions, the board should evaluate the climate risk of proposals to the company and its transition plan. For example, the board could rank proposals as high, medium and low risk, and ask proposers to list ways to mitigate risks greater than low. The board can then decide to disapprove or approve any given proposal with conditions. Example wording After due and careful consideration of the above matters, and each of the documents produced to the meeting, including consideration of: [the Company]'s emissions-reduction targets and interim targets [the Company]'s direct or indirect climate risks (including physical, transition and liability risks associated with the proposed activities) the impact of climate change on [the Company]'s business alternative options with a lower carbon footprint and giving rise to less climate risk measures for measuring, verifying and reducing [the Company]'s carbon footprint and reducing, mitigating and or avoiding the climate risks whether the proposed activities, and the activities and policies of any parties related to them (including their climate commitments, lobbying activities or trade association memberships), align with Paris Agreement goals , and whether any action should be taken to improve such alignment the impact on key stakeholders (including employees, clients, end customers and supply chain partners) of the proposed activities, any resourcing choices and the measures taken by [the Company] to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions the board's expertise in making decisions based upon these considerations and whether external advice should be sought from, or the decision or emissions measurements independently verified by, a qualified climate or sustainability professional, it was resolved… [decision reached following consideration of the above factors]. Require board approval for contracts that exceed targets Make board approval mandatory for any proposed contracts that would exceed agreed emissions-reduction targets. This gives the board greater oversight and control over transactions that may derail its transition plan . Establish governance and approval processes for the board to: define an emission threshold for transactions consider the impact on the company's emission targets of proposed transactions that exceed the threshold review and approve the carbon footprint of proposed transactions to ensure they are within the company's targets, and align with its decarbonisation strategy and transition plan. Example wording The proposal to enter into the transaction that exceeds the carbon threshold is [fully, partially or not] aligned with [the Company]'s: agreed emissions reduction targets transition plan business strategy for the following reasons: [insert reasons. Explain if the contract is aligned in one aspect, but not another.] The high-carbon transaction will help us achieve our transition plan by enabling us to deliver the interim commercial goals that are consistent with our near- and medium-term emissions-reduction targets for the following reasons: [insert reasons.] The high-carbon transaction may prevent us from achieving our transition plan and interim commercial and emissions-reduction targets. But: it is necessary because [insert rationale] it can be mitigated by [insert mitigation options] Climate clauses using the contractual solutions in this guide Glossary definitions used in this guide Related guides [END]"}]}

Climate risks include: physical: for example, extreme weather events or rises in sea level that degrade assets or supply chains transitional: for example, legislation and regulations, such as emissions-reduction laws or trade tariffs enacted to address climate impacts; technological mitigations of climate change; or changing consumer preferences liability: for example, climate and greenwashing litigation, or transition cases, including related fines, legal and court fees, insurance costs and reputational damage. Example wording Please provide information and copies of documents detailing: Whether [Party B] assesses and discloses climate risks and opportunities under [insert relevant domestic law or international reporting standard such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) ]. If so, please provide copies of any internal and external reports. Whether [Party B] has a climate risk register (or equivalent document). If the register is not updated or maintained, please provide details of all of the following: any known or reasonably foreseeable climate risks to [Party B]'s business possible legal, financial and commercial impacts of the climate crisis on [Party B]'s business, and the impact of [Party B]'s business on the climate. Any scenario analysis or stress-testing [Party B] has done on the impact of plausible climate futures on Party B's strategy and business model, including the impact of: rapid or disruptive transition scenarios to well below 2C, or 1.5C warming scenarios above 4C. Adaptation or resilience measures taken by [Party B] to minimise the exposure of [Party B], its business and operations to physical climate risks. Any current or proposed climate laws in jurisdictions [Party B] operates in that might impact [Party B]'s business, and how [Party B] intends to mitigate these impacts. [Party B]'s transition plan . Any past or current legal actions, regulatory fines or insurance costs related to [Party B]'s business, including its climate liability-mitigation plan. Any other climate-related awareness or horizon-scanning activities carried out by [Party B]. Supply chain, contracting and procurement Understand the climate risks and opportunities in the supply chain and procurement practices of the counterparty. Specifically: assess the impact of procurement practices on scope 3 emissions , including reporting and disclosure ensure that the counterparty's practices align with the organisation's emissions-reduction targets identify opportunities for decarbonisation, especially in counterparties with high emission levels. Read our guide Get information on contract emissions . Example wording Please provide information and copies of documents detailing: Any climate-related or sustainability due diligence [Party B] conducts when procuring goods or services, including information on greenhouse gas emissions related to the contract(s) under which it procures such goods or services. Any environmental obligations [Party B] includes in its contracts for the supply of goods or services. The percentage of contracts in [Party B]'s supply chain that contain decarbonisation and other climate-related obligations. Any contracts that exceed a material carbon footprint threshold of carbon dioxide equivalent and [Party B]'s right to terminate, renegotiate and vary the contracts. Employment Understand the role a counterparty's employees have in delivering emissions-reduction targets and other climate objectives. This helps to: understand how, and the extent to which, a counterparty educates, enables and empowers its staff to achieve its climate objectives assess if a counterparty can achieve its climate objectives based on how enabled and engaged its employees are. Example wording Please provide information and copies of documents detailing: Any pay or benefits of [Party B]'s employees or leadership team (including directors and managers) that are [linked to or conditional on] [Party B] achieving its emissions-reduction targets. Any dividends [Party B] pays to its shareholders that are [linked to or conditional on] [Party B] achieving its emissions-reduction targets. Any information or training [Party B] gives to its employees and leadership team (including directors and managers) regarding climate and its impact on [Party B]'s strategy, profitability and operations. Any other activities [Party B] carries out with its employees and leadership team (including directors and managers) to do all of the following: educate them about the climate crisis generally consult with them about potential changes to [Party B]'s business activities that would have a positive environmental impact. Any ‘green' employment benefits, terms or initiatives offered to [Party B]'s employees and their level of take-up. Any policies [Party B] has in place to reduce the carbon footprint caused by travel and commuting. What percentage of [Party B]'s fleet (including company cars) is electric. Resources Use the due diligence process as an opportunity to assess whether a counterparty is able to respond to the questions. Micro, small and medium-sized organisations may find it difficult to respond to the questions. This should not automatically exclude them from a contract or as an acquisition target. If they lack resources to provide a response, consider providing them the necessary resources, such as finance or training. Representations, warranties and indemnity Once due diligence is completed, and if the organisation decides to enter into a contract with the counterparty or into a transaction to acquire a target, ensure that the provisions on representations, warranties and indemnity apply to the responses to the climate questions in the due diligence questionnaire.

Price mechanisms Use the price paid for goods or services to incentivise suppliers to comply with obligations to meet climate targets. This is a powerful tool, but may require a high level of internal sign-off, and managing supplier expectations pre-contract, so it could prolong negotiations. Price increase Reward a supplier that meets or beats its contractual climate objectives with a price increase for the goods and services the organisation buys from the supplier. Agree the contractual climate objectives with the supplier, including emissions-reduction targets. See [Daniel's Clause] Sustainability Key Performance Indicators in Construction Works Task Orders for an example of objectives. Best-practice objectives on emissions require a reduction of the supplier's scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions . Trigger the price increase if the supplier meets or beats its objectives. Require the supplier to integrate the contractual climate objectives and, where relevant, the price mechanism into its own supply chain contracts. Example wording If [Party B] meets the climate objectives in clause [● on climate objectives] during [a calendar year of the contractual term], [Party A] shall pay [Party B] an increase in the price of percent in the next calendar year by [date]. If [Party B] exceeds the climate objectives in clause [● on climate objectives] during [a calendar year of the contractual term] by up to percent, [Party A] shall pay [Party B] an increase in the price of percent in the next calendar year [subject to a cap of ● percent] by [date]. [Party B] shall [use best endeavours to] ensure that clauses [● on price uplift] are added to any and all of its [commercial] contracts that relate to its obligations under this agreement. Gain-share payment Incentivise a supplier to meet or exceed its contractual climate objectives in exchange for a gain-share payment. The payment can be calculated by reference to the value of the goods or services provided under the contract. Example wording If [Party B] reduces [contract-related] scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions by more than percent each year when compared to the previous year, as required by clause [● (Agreed Reduction)], the following gain-share mechanism shall apply: Total Reduction = the absolute reduction in carbon footprint between [year] and [the following year] Additional Reduction = Total Reduction less the Agreed Reduction Gain-share Payment = Additional Reduction x market rate to offset 1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent x 50 percent. The maximum cumulative value of any Gain-share Payment(s) due to [Party B] in any year of the contract shall be equal to percent of the value of the [goods or services] provided by [Party B] to [Party A] in respect of that same year. The carbon footprint is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent . Price reduction Reduce the price the organisation pays for goods and services if the supplier fails to meet contractual climate obligations. Example wording [Party B] shall reduce the scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions related to the performance of this agreement according to the emissions-reduction targets in schedule . 1. No variation in price The price does not change if [Party B]'s [contract-related] scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions are: less than equal to within percent of the emissions-reduction targets in schedule . 2. Simple discount If [Party B]'s [contract-related] scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions, as calculated in accordance with schedule , are more than the emissions-reduction targets in schedule by percent, the price paid by [Party A] is reduced by percent. 3. Matching discount If [Party B]'s [contract-related] scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions are more than the emissions-reduction targets in schedule by percent, the price reduces by the same percentage amount by which the emissions exceed the emissions-reduction targets [up to a cap of percent]. This price adjustment takes effect on [date] and will last until the end of the agreement unless superseded by this clause. Rebate Give the supplier a rebate on the price of goods or services the organisation buys under a contract if the supplier meets or beats its contractual climate obligations. Example wording [Party B] shall meet the emissions-reduction targets in schedule . The price for [goods or services] will change relative to [Party B]'s performance against the emissions-reduction targets in schedule according to this clause . 1. No variation If [Party B]'s scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions are: less than equal to within percent of the emissions-reduction targets in schedule , the price will not change. 2. Simple rebate If [Party B] has reduced its scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions by more than the emissions-reduction targets in schedule by at least percent, the price paid to [Party B] increases by percent. 3. Matching rebate If [Party B]'s scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions are less than the emissions-reduction targets in schedule by at least percent, the price increases by the same percentage amount [up to a cap of percent]. This price adjustment takes effect on [date]. Step-in rights If a supplier fails to meet contractual climate obligations, use a step-in right for the organisation to perform the work, or appoint a third party to perform the work at the supplier's expense. Step-in rights are a common feature of services contracts and can include climate-related requirements. Suppliers will want to avoid triggering a step-in clause because of the cost, disruption and potential loss of competitive advantage. For example, if the third party appointed to take over the work is a competitor. This incentivises the supplier to meet the obligation. Audit rights If a supplier fails to meet its climate obligations, use the right to request a full audit of the supplier's climate performance (or even overall performance) under the contract. If an independent auditor confirms that the supplier failed to achieve its contractual climate obligations, consider making the supplier liable for the cost of the audit. The management time and financial costs of audits are onerous and a powerful incentive for the supplier to meet climate obligations. Remedy a breach Require the supplier to report breaches of its contractual climate obligations, and propose a remedy for the breach within a fixed period. If the breach cannot be remedied, or is not remedied satisfactorily, the organisation can choose to: terminate the contract trigger step-in rights recover losses through other damages provisions. Example wording If [Party B] breaches clause [● on climate obligations], [Party B] shall, within business days of becoming aware of the breach, submit a report to [Party A] (a Breach Report ). A Breach Report shall set out all of the following: the nature, severity and duration of the breach the cause(s) of the breach steps taken to mitigate the causes the plan for remedying the breach (the Remedial Plan ). The Remedial Plan must explain how [Party B] will further investigate, mitigate and remedy the breach and provide evidence of mitigation and remediation. The Remedial Plan must also include the timescales by which the remediation will be completed. The Remedial Plan must be approved by [Party A]. Approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. [Party A] may also: comment on the Remedial Plan provide reasonable suggestions for investigating and remedying the reported breach require that [Party B] remedies the reported breach within [a reasonable period of time]. [Party B] shall provide [Party A] with an updated Remedial Plan [every ● time period] calculated by reference to the date of the Breach Report. Each updated Remedial Plan shall detail [Party B]'s progress in remedying the breach since the most recent Remedial Plan. Impose climate-specific liquidated damages Impose liquidated damages if the supplier fails to meet its contracted emissions-reduction target. Calculate the amount as the cost of buying high-quality carbon offsets to make up the difference between the supplier's target and its actual emissions. Example wording [Party B] shall meet the contract emissions-reduction targets in schedule . If [Party A acting reasonably or an independent auditor] determines that [Party B] has failed to meet [any of] the emissions-reduction targets in schedule : [Party B] will pay [Party A] a sum equal to the cost of buying High-quality Carbon Credits to offset the amount of emissions by which [Party B] missed the emissions-reduction target[s], [Party A] shall use the sum to buy the High-quality Carbon Credits. High-quality Carbon Credits means carbon credits bought from a project: that has been verified by [insert name of voluntary standard] or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change clean development mechanism [or successor UNFCCC mechanism] where the emissions avoided, reduced or removed by the project are additional that prioritises removing emissions from the atmosphere rather than avoiding or reducing third party emissions that uses storage methods with a low risk of reversal over millennia for removing emissions that takes account of a just transition and addresses wider social and environmental goals. Alternatively, pay the liquidated damages to a climate adaptation and resilience fund. Example wording [Party B] shall pay to [Party A] a sum equal to the cost of buying High-quality Carbon Credits to offset the amount of emissions by which [Party B] missed the emissions-reduction target(s) [Party A] shall donate the sum to [insert climate adaptation and resilience fund]. Terminate for a greener alternative Include the right to terminate the contract in favour of a third party that can fulfil the contract with lower associated greenhouse gas emissions . This incentivises suppliers to continuously improve their performance on climate to retain the contract. Example wording [Party A] may serve written notice on [Party B] (the Green Improvement Notice ) that it has identified a third party who can provide [the goods or services] with reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions when compared to [Party B] (the Green Improvement). Within days of being served with the Green Improvement Notice, [Party B] shall notify [Party A] if it can match or exceed the Green Improvement. If [Party B] can demonstrate to [Party A]'s reasonable satisfaction that it can match or exceed the Green Improvement, the parties shall use all reasonable endeavours acting in good faith to agree the amended terms on which [Party B] shall provide the [goods or services] incorporating the Green Improvement or greater. The amended terms to include the price where relevant. [Party A] may terminate this agreement by giving [Party B] at least [● months'] notice, if [Party B]: fails to respond to the Green Improvement Notice is unable to demonstrate to [Party A]'s reasonable satisfaction that it can match the Green Improvement. Other climate-related grounds for termination Include climate-related grounds for terminating the contract alongside standard grounds for termination. Example wording [Party A] may terminate this agreement with immediate effect if [Party B] commits a material or persistent breach of any of the climate obligations in this agreement and, if such breach can be remedied, fails to remedy that breach within days after being notified [in writing] to do so. [Party A] may terminate this agreement by giving months' written notice to [Party B] if: [Party A] decides to switch to an alternative [supplier or third party] to reduce its scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions [Party B]'s environmental practices, negative environmental impacts, lobbying activities, partnerships, trade associations or public policy positions bring [Party A]'s reputation into disrepute or conflict with [Party A]'s emissions-reduction targets [Party B] fails within days to respond fully to a request for information made by [Party A] to assess [Party B]'s scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions, environmental practices and policies that relate to [the activities] under this agreement. Conditions precedent Conditions precedent are most useful where the organisation can exercise non-contractual power over a supplier. For example, the organisation might withhold the award of a call-off contract under a framework, or refuse to grant preferred-supplier status until climate pre-conditions are met. This approach: incentivises suppliers to set and meet climate goals and contractual climate obligations that meet or exceed the organisation's scope 3 emissions targets penalises suppliers who do not perform by withholding a future but discretionary benefit. For example, future contracts under the framework agreement. Awarding contracts under a framework agreement Sometimes organisations have discretion under a framework agreement to award suppliers non-tendered call-off contracts or contracts for mini tenders. If so, use the discretion to award contracts to suppliers who: have climate goals, such as a net-zero target and transition plan are meeting their climate obligations in existing contracts with the organisation. Special supplier status Where suppliers hold special status (for example, preferred supplier): make special status conditional on the supplier achieving and maintaining agreed climate goals create a mechanism for removing special status if the supplier fails to maintain them. This approach incentivises suppliers to protect their special status by meeting contractually agreed climate goals and obligations. Provide a route back to special status. If a supplier loses their special status, the organisation should maintain the relationship with the supplier while both parties work collaboratively to help the supplier regain special status.

Alongside that, it provides a Sustainability Compliance Certificate certifying that, in 2021, it reduced CO2 emissions by 4.20% and Water consumption by 0.32% (in each case compared to the Baseline). B has therefore met both the SPTs. Therefore, the applicable Margin will be reduced by 0.125%, i.e. the Margin B will pay for the applicable interest period will be 1.025%. Note: The example is illustrative only. SLLs do not have to take the form of new money financing. SLL provisions can also be included during the course of any amendment or refinancing of an existing loan facility. Whilst there are no mandatory frameworks for determining what an SLL is, the European market has coalesced around the LMA Sustainability Linked Loan Principles . LMA Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles What is a Sustainability-Linked Loan? Any type of loan instrument or contingent facility which incentivises the borrower's achievement of ambitious, pre-determined sustainability performance objectives . What are sustainability performance objectives? Sustainability performance is measured using Sustainability Performance Targets ( SPTs ), set against Key Performance Indicators ( KPIs ) which measure improvements in the borrower's sustainability profile. The Core Components Core Component Consideration Mandatory? Y/N (1) Relationship to Overall CSR Strategy Overall sustainability objectives and strategy communicated to lenders? Mandatory ? Do the selected SPTs align with the borrower's overarching sustainability objectives and strategy, policy and processes? Encouraged ? The financing terms should align to the sustainability strategy. Incorporate reward for achieving the SPT. Conversely, failure to meet a minimum SPT leads to loss of the incentive. Mandatory ? Disclose sustainability standards or certifications obtained or to which borrower is seeking to conform. Encouraged ? (2) Target Setting – Measuring the Sustainability of the Borrower Negotiate and set the SPTs with the lender(s). Consider using a Sustainability Coordinator or Sustainability Structuring Agent to assist. Mandatory ? SPTs can be internally defined by reference to the borrower's own global sustainability strategy, or externally (e.g. using independent ratings criteria). Mandatory ? Are the SPTs ambitious and meaningful to the business? Targets should be based on recent (e.g. 6-12 month) performance levels. Mapping of SPTs against materiality assessment of the borrower or industry to be conducted by the borrower. Mandatory ? SPTs shall not be set lower, or set on a slower trajectory, than those already adopted internally or announced publicly. Mandatory ? SPTs shall reference a sustainability improvement based on a predetermined benchmark. Consider both the importance of the ESG issue on a materiality assessment plus the scope for improvement. Mandatory ? SPTs to apply over the life of the loan Mandatory ? Obtain a third party opinion on the SPTs and alignment with relevant frameworks as a condition precedent to SPT appropriateness. Alternatively, demonstrate internal expertise on methodology verification. Strongly recommended ? (3) Reporting Keep readily available and up-to-date information relating to the SPTs. Ensure internal processes are set up for this purpose. Mandatory ? External ESG ratings and/or performance reviews by external auditors, if used, should be maintained. Encouraged ? Provide sustainability/ESG information to lenders at least once per annum. This should include reports on performance against the SPTs and confirmation that there has been no change to the calculation methodology applied. Mandatory ? Where providing SPT information, details of underlying methodology, baselines and/or assumptions to be included. Encouraged ? For private companies, consider publicly reporting information on the SPTs, through annual reports or sustainability reports. Encouraged ? (4) Review Consider having an external review conducted as a condition precedent. Where appropriate ? Consider having performance against SPTs independently verified by an external reviewer at least once per annum. If information is not publicly reported, strongly recommended External reviews, if conducted, should be by a qualified external reviewer (e.g. auditor, environmental consultant, or independent ratings agency). ? External reviews should be made publicly available. Where appropriate ? If no external review is conducted, demonstrate or develop internal expertise for validation of calculation of performance against SPTs. Mandatory, if no external review conducted ? Documentation No standard wording is available for use in SLL documentation. There are various voluntary template wording in the market (e.g. The Chancery Lane Project ( TCLP) and TCLP's Casper's Clause (​Sustainability-Linked Loans) available for use. However, most lenders and private practice law firms active in this space would have their own language for use based on prior transaction experience. Drafting guidelines Source and baseline of SPTs should be clearly set out. The mechanism for measuring improvement relative to the SPT should be clearly documented. Are the SPTs specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound? Do they set an appropriate level of net zero ambition aligned with achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in particular pursuing efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, halving absolute emissions every decade and achieving net zero or net negative emissions by 2050 or sooner? Please see The Chancery Lane Project's Net Zero Checklist , Net Zero Explainer and Net Zero: What is it? Video for further information. Where information is being relied on to measure the SPT, consider whether independent verification will be required. The benefits and consequences of failure to meet SPTs should be clearly defined. The most typical benefit is a margin step-down, and the most typical (if any) consequence for failure to meet a minimum standard is a pricing step-up. Typically, there is no Default / Event of Default arising for failure to meet the SPTs. Consequences of breaching ancillary provisions (e.g. failure to provide information, inaccurate reporting) should also be clearly set out – unlike failure to meet the SPTs, these could lead to Default / Event of Default. For longer-term loans, SPTs may not be able to be accurately set in advance, or external events or circumstances may require amendment to the SPTs. Include provisions that clearly define conditions under which SPT definitions or calibrations can be updated to ensure sustained alignment with business and sustainability commitments. What would an example of an SPT look like? Sustainability is generally synonymous with ESG. There is no definitive list of sustainability / ESG issues, but the table below provides examples of ESG improvements against which SPT parameters can be defined for guidance purposes. Ideally, the SPTs should align with existing sustainability targets of the Borrower, its net zero target and its interim targets to achieve its net zero target, including organisational emissions reduction targets, a year on year percentage reduction of the Borrower's emissions (a minimum of 7% if intended to be consistent with the aim of halving emissions every decade) and the quality of offset credits purchased in neutralising and compensating for residual emissions. They may also include ESG-related governance, training and education of the workforce and climate policy engagement (e.g. lobbying and trade association memberships). Please see TCLP's Net Zero Checklist and Net Zero Explainer for further information.

Choose the appropriate documents This guide is for any organisation. The example wording in this guide is written for a board resolution of a company but it can be just as easily used in corporate constitutional documents and by organisations that are not companies. It can be more difficult to amend constitutional documents, but including climate wording in them will have more impact. It will be harder to remove and will affect corporate governance frameworks and directors' duties. Commit to measure, manage and report on emissions at board level Ideally, an organisation will measure: its own greenhouse gas emissions ( scope 1 and 2 ) emissions from its value chain ( scope 3 ). Agree a reporting standard or a common supplier to calculate the company's emissions. Domestic law might mandate a reporting standard. Where there is no legal requirement, use internationally recognised standards (for example, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) . Measuring, managing and reporting on emissions should be approved by the board or most senior leadership team with ultimate responsibility for overseeing operations. Read our guide Factor climate considerations into board decisions . Example wording [The Company] confirms that it measures, manages and reports its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with [ The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition 2015 , as amended periodically]. The directors of [the Company] nominate [name of director] to be responsible for ensuring that [the Company] measures, manages and reports on its greenhouse gas emissions. Set emissions-reduction targets and timeframe Ideally, the emissions-reduction targets will: define the scope of emissions covered by the target. Best practice is to set targets relating to an organisation's own emissions ( scope 1 and 2 ) and emissions from its value chain ( scope 3 ) as classified by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard include short- (annual) and medium-term (2 to 5 years) interim targets be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative or other international standard align with the Paris Agreement goals and latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change findings. To affirm commitment to decarbonisation, organisations could also: align their emissions-reduction targets with another internationally recognised standard for setting targets join the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change's Race to Zero campaign. Example wording [The Company] confirms that it will: reduce its scope 1 and 2 [and 3] emissions by percent by [short- or medium-term year] from a [year] base year set public annual emissions-reduction targets [that are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative] join [ Race to Zero ] within months of entering into this [agreement or resolution]. Develop a transition plan An organisation's transition plan must contain concrete and measurable steps so that its decarbonisation strategy can be implemented and its emissions-reduction targets met within the agreed timeframe. Check the latest guidance for your jurisdiction and international recommendations to ensure that your transition plan delivers credible and meaningful decarbonisation. A best-practice transition plan should include: interim greenhouse gas emissions -reduction targets that align with the Science Based Targets initiative's Corporate Net-Zero Standard or other international standard short-, medium- and long-term actions to achieve the emissions-reduction targets a plan for how meeting targets will be financed if verified credits from a recognised offset provider may be used to offset any residual emissions governance and accountability mechanisms to support the transition plan, including reporting, and linking executive remuneration to achieving interim targets measures to mitigate risks to employees, stakeholders (for example suppliers, communities and customers) and the environment measures to maximise opportunities for employees, stakeholders and the environment promotion of a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Publish decarbonisation objectives and report on progress Ideally, an organisation will publish publicly an annual report on its progress to reduce emissions. As part of the organisation's commitment to reduce emissions, outline the minimum requirements of what the report must include. Check the latest guidance for your jurisdiction and international recommendations to ensure the organisation complies with reporting and disclosure requirements and standards.

Flexible working policy: home working to support achievement of net zero target 11.1 We are committed to providing equality of opportunity in employment and to developing working practices and policies that support work-life balance. Our Flexible Working Policy gives you an opportunity to formally request a change to your working pattern. 11.2 Line managers are encouraged to facilitate requests unless they cannot be accommodated for business or operational reasons. Advice will be sought from the Sustainability Team in each instance to ensure the environmental benefits of each flexible working are given due consideration and an appropriate weighting. 11.3 In particular, we recognise that flexible working offers an opportunity for our business to reduce our Carbon Footprint that will contribute to achieving our Net Zero Target. Accordingly, we support home working in appropriate circumstances either occasionally (to respond to specific circumstances or to complete particular tasks) and in some cases on a regular (full or part-time) basis. 11.4 Homeworking can be authorised by your line manager (having sought advice from the Sustainability Team) where, in their opinion: (a) you have work that can be done at home; (b) working at home is cost-effective and any increase in work that may be passed to your colleagues as a result is kept to a minimum; and (c) working from home (either occasionally or regularly, as applicable) will significantly reduce our Carbon Footprint and the emissions of GHG associated with your commute and/or have another positive environmental impact. 11.5 If you wish to apply to work from home, you will need to be able to show that you can: (a) work independently, motivate yourself and use your own initiative; (b) manage your workload effectively and complete work to set deadlines; (c) identify and resolve any new pressures created by working at home; (d) adapt to new working practices including maintaining contact with your line manager and colleagues at work; and (e) significantly reduce our Carbon Footprint and the emissions of GHG associated with your commute and/or or have another positive environmental impact. 11.6 [When working at home, you are responsible for operating your virtual office in a sustainable manner (for example, buying 100 (one hundred) percent renewable energy and avoiding single-use office supplies).] 11.7 In support of this, we offer each employee an annual home working allowance up to the value of £[ ● ]. Please contact the [HR Team] to claim your home working allowance. Purchases can be made from our approved suppliers only. You will be expected to provide copies of your receipts and will be reimbursed in the next payroll run following your purchase. 12. Holiday policy: additional holiday to encourage sustainable travel 12.1 To allow you to make a more sustainable choice when considering how to use your holiday entitlement: (a) you may claim 1 (one) additional days holiday (to be added to the start or end of your trip) where you decide to travel to a [domestic] holiday destination for a holiday of more than 5 (five) working days without flying to that destination (for example, by choosing to travel by car, rail or ferry); and (b) you may claim 2 (two) additional days' holiday (to be added to the start or end of your trip) where you decide to travel to a [foreign] holiday destination for a holiday of more than 5 (five) working days without flying to that destination (for example, by choosing to travel by rail or ferry). 12.2 Claims for additional holiday must be approved by the [HR Team] at least 1 (one) month in advance of your holiday and you can only claim for additional holiday once in each holiday year. 13. Procurement policy: sustainable procurement, single-use plastics, waste and water conservation 13.1 Please see our [procurement policy] for details of our commitment to sustainable resourcing choices, including sourcing local, low carbon materials where possible, making sustainable food sourcing choices, requiring our suppliers to reduce their emissions of GHG, following circular economy principles and [ insert details ] for our policy of minimising food waste and general waste. Please see [ insert ] for our water conservation policy and [ insert ] for our policy on promoting nature and biodiversity within our operations. 13.2 Plastic waste is one of the greatest environmental pollution challenges facing the world today. In response to this, we expect you to try to eliminate the use of single-use plastics in our working environment and supply chain. Single-use plastics are disposable plastics, which are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled. 13.3 This policy seeks to identify where use of single-use plastics is prevalent and where more sustainable replacements can be chosen. Monitoring usage of single-use plastics will help us to implement a measurable reduction plan. 13.4 Together, we make a commitment to: (a) work with each other ensure that the use of single-use plastics is eliminated from our working environment; (b) work with our partners to ensure that single-use plastics are not used at any events that we hold or have a role in organising; (c) work with each other, our partners and the local business community to develop innovative projects to eliminate the use of single-use plastics across the local business community; and (d) share best practice and information about our single-use plastic elimination initiatives with each other, our partners and the local business community. 13.5 Where the use of plastics is unavoidable, we will encourage the use of recycled plastics, where practicable and wish to support manufacturers that make products from locally sourced waste plastics. 14. Training policy: environmental and sustainability training programmes 14.1 We are committed to developing the skills of our employees and recognise that training can benefit us, our staff and the environment. Staff will receive training appropriate to their role, subject to need, and to operational and budgetary considerations. 14.2 Training needs will be identified through regular performance reviews. You will be given appropriate access to training to enable you to progress within our business. 14.3 [We encourage employees to enrol onto OR Employees [must OR are expected to attend] our internal environmental and sustainability training programmes during their usual working hours (and online as required) [regularly OR quarterly OR annually]. These training programmes will cover details of our public and contractual commitments, targets and governance in relation to climate change and sustainability, the latest climate science, climate change policy and relevant legal context, the economic, social and health benefits in reducing the workplace's environmental impact, education regarding sustainable eating habits, lifestyle changes and how to access support to achieve them, promotion of the protection and enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystems, the importance of achieving a zero-carbon working environment and other topical climate and sustainability issues. 14.4 You may also seek approval from the Sustainability Team to enrol onto external environmental and sustainability training programmes [where you have a justifiable business need for additional knowledge]. Please discuss any ideas you may have with the Sustainability Team. 14.5 External environmental and sustainability training programmes do not need to lead to a formal qualification. The only limitation is that their purpose must be to enable you to improve the environmental performance of our business and/or better contribute towards the achievement of our Net Zero Target. 15. Whistleblowing policy: environmental whistleblowing 15.1 Whistleblowing is the disclosure of information which relates to suspected wrongdoing or dangers at work. This may include: (a) failure to comply with any legal or professional obligation or regulatory requirements (including environmental law); (b) conduct that detrimentally impacts our ability to achieve our Net Zero Target; (c) conduct which causes damage to the climate or the environment (which is not part of a reasonable working life); (d) conduct likely to damage our reputation as an environmentally conscious business; or (e) the deliberate concealment of any of the above matters. 16.

We are committed to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in particular pursuing efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, halving absolute greenhouse gas emissions every decade and achieving net zero or net negative emissions by 2050 or sooner. Accordingly, we require all of our Suppliers to commit to providing an environmental and sustainability training programme (the Environmental and Sustainability Training Programme ) to their employees, personnel and contractors on a regular basis (at least six sessions per year [or, for Suppliers with less than 10 employees, at the start of the contract and every year thereafter for the life of the contract]) paid for by the Supplier. Such programme will cover, as a minimum: (a) the latest climate science (including the projected impacts of global warming of 2°C above pre-industrial levels versus 1.5°C, the rationale for the target of reaching net zero by 2050, key components of the concept of net zero and an outline of the transition pathways required to reach net zero by 2050); (b) climate change policy and relevant legal context (including core terms of the Paris Agreement and any national implementation measures); (c) details of the Supplier's own public and contractual commitments, targets, offsetting activities, governance, lobbying, leadership and public policy positions and its pursuit of a just transition in relation to climate change and Sustainability; (d) the economic and social (e.g. health) benefits to the Supplier in reducing the workplace's environmental impact and carbon footprint; (e) Sustainable lifestyle changes and issues relating to the Supplier's workplace such as: energy efficiency, digital meetings, food and travel choices, renewable energy and smart waste management, and may cover, without limitation: (f) extreme weather events and other climate change impacts and adaptation strategies; (g) climate change and immigration; (h) protection and enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystems; (i) low carbon technology innovations; and (j) other topical climate and Sustainability issues, where Sustainability or Sustainable means or describes initiatives and practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, including the conservation of resources, all of which are assumed to be finite. There are many ways for Suppliers to programme and structure their training. Some of the ideas [the Customer has/ we have] considered and adopted for [its/ our] own training programme include: presentations from climate scientists, engineers and other similar experts; reports from NGOs working in communities facing extreme and adverse weather events or wildlife conservationists; an update from management on the Company's net zero/ environmental/ carbon neutral strategy; internal presentations of interest from staff on Sustainable lifestyle changes; hosting an environmental film screening; and/ or guest Q&As from Sustainability experts and leaders in your industry. We may request information on your Environmental and Sustainability Training Programme on an annual basis, or as reasonably necessary, to understand how you are complying with this requirement.

(B) The parties agree to pursue Recital (A) in a manner that promotes a just transition to a low carbon economy and results in at least a 7% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions year on year. Evan's Protocols Green execution protocols which parties can adopt at the start of a transaction to minimise the carbon footprint of deal execution. Green Transaction Protocols 1. Green General Principles The parties agree to use their [best/ reasonable] endeavours: 1.1 To conduct the transaction in [the most environmentally conscious manner possible/ a manner that is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement] and to reduce, to the fullest extent possible, the scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (as defined by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition 2015 as updated from time to time ) that arise as a consequence of the transaction process. The transaction process must be structured so that it does not increase or amplify the impact of climate change or the greenhouse gas emissions of the Parties. 1.2 [To measure all greenhouse gas emissions arising from the transaction and to report such emissions to the other party within [a reasonable time] after completion.] 1.3 To reduce [by [ ● %]/ to [ ●* ]] paper-based documents and correspondence where electronic versions offer a viable alternative. Where printing is unavoidable, recycled and sustainably sourced paper must be used. 1.4 To reduce data consumption [by [ ● %]/ to [ ●* ]] (including in the manner contemplated by Protocol 6 (Electronic Communications & Data Storage)). 1.5 To reduce travel [by [ ● %]/ to [ ●* ]] and conduct meetings remotely, as far as practicable. 1.6 To reduce the use of single-use plastics [by [ ● %]/ to [ ●* ]] and recycle all materials used. * 1.7 To include clauses within the transaction agreements to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the subject of the transaction. 1.8 To require that all third parties and advisers engaged during the course of the transaction are mindful of, and adhere to, these Green General Principles and the Green Transaction Protocols to which the Parties have subscribed. 1.9 Exceptions to these principles are subject to prior approval by [ ●* ]. Where exceptions are justified and permitted (for example, business travel or document printing), associated greenhouse gas emissions are to be calculated using Carbon Footprint Standards and offset by the purchase of an equivalent quantity of carbon credits at the end of the transaction by [the Parties][the incurring Party] within [6 months] after the end of the transaction from a project that has been verified in accordance with [insert name of voluntary standard] or from a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) clean development mechanism (CDM) [or [successor/ equivalent] UNFCCC mechanism] project. Any such offsetting shall: (a) prioritise projects that remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere rather than avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (b) favour long lived storage methods which have low risk of reversal over millennia; and (c) as far as possible, align with the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting . For the purposes of this paragraph [1.9], Carbon Footprint Standards means internationally recognised standards to measure, manage and demonstrate carbon credentials covering: (i) organisations (including but not limited to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Voluntary Environmental Reporting Guidelines and The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition 2015 ); (ii) projects, product and services (including but not limited to PAS 2050:2011 , ISO 14001 and the GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard ); and (iii) events (including but not limited to PAS2060 / ISO 20121 ).** * ** [ See TCLP Glossary: Carbon Footprint Standards for further definitions and explanatory notes. ] 2. Correspondence 2.1 The Parties agree to correspond internally, with each other and with third parties in relation to the transaction by way of electronic communication only, and not to print copies of electronic communications relating to the transaction unnecessarily. The Parties agree to require the same standards of all third parties wherever possible. 2.2 The Parties agree not to request hard copy documents from each other or third parties unnecessarily. 2.3 The Parties should share or agree on the following at the inception of the transaction: (a) the relevant email addresses to which all email communications between the parties and all relevant third parties are to be sent if not using a shared platform for all communications; (b) the maximum size of file accepted (for example, 15MB) and that documents should be compressed or zipped wherever possible to reduce data storage carbon costs; and (c) the platform agreed by the parties for the sharing of larger documents, if documents exceed the maximum accepted file size. 2.4 Where an exception is approved in accordance with paragraph 1.9 above, the Parties agree that written correspondence which cannot be delivered electronically must be printed double-sided and two sheets to a page wherever possible, and/ or in A5 format. All printed correspondence must be delivered in the most environmentally friendly manner that is reasonably possible and non-recyclable binding materials, envelopes and/ or packaging are not permitted. Once no longer needed, hard copy correspondence must be recycled in a secure and confidential manner. 3. Documentation 3.1 The Parties must avoid printing any documents[, wherever possible]. Electronic delivery systems (such as data rooms, document sharing platforms and screen sharing) should be used to provide access to the Parties and to third parties (such as investors or creditors). Electronic bibles (E-bibles) should be used at the close of the transaction. 3.2 When compiling materials for internal preparation and analysis purposes, the parties must use electronic means[, wherever possible]. 3.3 Where hard copies are required or unavoidable, the Parties must print double-sided and two sheets to a page wherever possible and/ or in A5 format on recycled, recyclable or sustainably sourced paper. If these documents need updating, parties should amend existing bundles instead of recreating them. 3.4 Once no longer needed, hard copy documentation must be recycled in a secure and confidential manner. 3.5 Non-recyclable document binding materials (such as glossy plastic presentation covers, plastic spiral binders etc.) should not be used. 3.6 Where it is necessary to deliver hard copy documentation, wherever possible (and as agreed by the Parties) these should be sent by non-motorised transport (such as cycle courier) or in electronic format to a local print agency who can deliver to the intended recipient. 3.7 As regards electronic documents, the Parties agree that these should be made searchable, to facilitate electronic mark-ups and reduce printing. 3.8 Subject to local law requirements, the Parties agree that electronic signatures and remote signing procedures should be used to sign documents. In particular, the Parties agree to sign transaction documents in counterpart to avoid unnecessary printing, couriering or in-person signing where travel may be required. 3.9 Wherever possible, the Parties agree that the transaction original documents and signature pages must be in electronic format to avoid unnecessary printing, couriering, storage and recycling. 3.10 Where it is necessary to physically sign hard copy documents, the Parties will avoid the use of disposable plastic pens and must instead use a reusable fountain pen, manufactured locally wherever possible, for any required physical signing, and will fill those pens with waterproof ink from recyclable bottles so as to avoid plastic waste from ink cartridges.* * [ Be aware that certain fountain pen inks are washable and therefore not suitable for the execution of legal documents. Fountain pen inks marked “permanent”, “waterproof”, “iron gall” or “bulletproof” should be obtained, preferably from local manufacturers such as Diamine (UK), Noodlers (USA), Platinum (Japan) and Blackstone (Australia). ] 4. Diligence, Data Rooms and Site Visits 4.1 Due diligence materials must be made available via virtual data rooms, wherever possible, to reduce travel and paper waste. The Parties also agree not to upload extraneous documents to virtual data rooms, wherever possible, and not to download documents where they can be evaluated in situ on the virtual data room. 4.2 Where physical diligence or site visits are strictly required, see Protocol 5 (Meetings). 5. Meetings 5.1 Meetings between the Parties and their respective experts and advisers, and between the Parties' experts and advisers (including roadshows, site visits and closing ceremonies), must be held remotely, where practicable. Where not practicable, meetings must be arranged in an environmentally conscious manner. 5.2 In exceptional cases where travelling is necessary, the Parties must endeavour to travel in the most environmentally friendly manner that is reasonably possible (such as using public transport or hybrid and electric vehicles, wherever possible). 5.3 Where travel is required, the relevant Party must account for and offset any associated greenhouse gas emissions. 5.4 The Parties must minimise unnecessary travel both by their own teams and by their advisory and counsel teams and, where it is necessary to travel, to do so using the minimum number of trips. Where a taxi journey is necessary, employees should pool or share cars, wherever possible. 6. Electronic Communications & Data Storage The Parties recognise the carbon footprint of electronic communications (such as the energy used for data storage by data centres). Therefore, to minimise such carbon footprint, the Parties agree to the extent reasonably practicable to: (a) check draft emails before sending them to ensure they contain the necessary and correct information to avoid the need for follow-up emails; (b) avoid replying to all (replies should be required and sent only to the original sender rather than to all distribution lists of the Parties); (c) send attachments only where necessary and in PDF rather than Powerpoint or other format; and (d) regularly clean and maintain mailing lists. 7. Deal memorabilia 7.1 The Parties agree to avoid producing and distributing deal memorabilia (toys, tombstones, etc.), and will, as an alternative way of commemorating a completed deal, consider making donations to charities or initiatives that actively mitigate climate change and/ or promote biodiversity (such as planting a tree). Where for relevant cultural reasons some form of memorabilia is deemed necessary, any products commissioned will only be produced from recycled or sustainably sourced materials, and distribution methods will be managed in an environmentally conscious manner. [7.2. The Parties agree that any publicity related to the transaction shall include mention that these Green Transaction Protocols were followed in relation to the transaction.] [8. Breach] [END]"}]}

The director shall be described in this clause as the Environmental Specialist Director or ESD. The narratives and terms are for companies who want to bring a more diverse range of perspectives (specifically, the perspectives of Indigenous Peoples) to board decision-making and oversight of the company's operations and transition to net zero. The narratives may be expanded upon and embedded, as appropriate, in one or more of the corporate governance documents outlined in Part 1 and in this Part 2. 1. Definition of Environmental Specialist Director (ESD) 1.1 The Environmental Specialist Director ( ESD ) is an individual who is appointed as a board director with specialist skills in: 1.1.1 climate/ the environment; 1.1.2 Indigenous and traditional knowledge[; and 1.1.3 chairing a specialist board committee]. 1.2 The [suggested] key characteristics of the individual appointed as ESD include that such a person: 1.2.1 is appointed as an executive or non-executive Board member; 1.2.2 is capable of chairing an Advisory Board Committee; 1.2.3 demonstrates a set of key experience, skills, knowledge, or competencies; 1.2.4 is an Indigenous Person with specific skills and traditional knowledge in the climate/ environment preferably within the stipulated region/ territory; and 1.2.5 may need to meet gender (or other relevant and specific) diversity targets/ preferences related to the company's diversity policy. 1.3 A non-exhaustive list of the corporate governance and policy documents that may be relevant to giving effect to the appointment of the ESD include: 1.3.1 constitutional documents (including board composition, board skills matrix, articles of association); 1.3.2 shareholders' agreement; 1.3.3 human resources policy; and 1.3.4 diversity policy. 2. Accountability and responsibilities of the ESD 2.1 The role and responsibilities of the ESD are as follows: 2.1.1 the position is reserved (where possible) for a person (or persons) with traditional Indigenous knowledge and expertise; 2.1.2 the ESD must be capable of chairing a board committee of climate/ environment specialists; and 2.1.3 the ESD must also fulfil their other obligations as a director by acting in the best interests of the company at all material times, across all the board functions. 3. Accountabilities and responsibilities of the ESD as chair of the specialist board committee on the environment 3.1 The company shall establish a specialist board committee on the environment (for example an advisory committee for environment and climate change) (the Advisory Board Committee ). The Advisory Board Committee shall oversee (and be empowered to make) binding decisions that involve the climate and the environment as it affects the company. 3.2 The ESD shall be appointed as chair of the Advisory Board Committee with the following accountabilities and responsibilities: 3.2.1 providing oversight and advice in relation to climate change, the environment, lands and waters, ecosystems, natural resources and biodiversity; 3.2.2 introducing, promoting and overseeing a process for regular consultations with stakeholders and stakeholder groups; 3.2.3 overseeing decisions related to the Advisory Board Committee and other matters; 3.2.4 acting as a high-level authority/ expert on specific climate and environmental issues including biodiversity, land, ecosystems, the environment, cultural sites, water, air, flora and wildlife; 3.2.5 providing advisory services to the Board in the Director's area of expertise; 3.2.6 engaging and appropriately communicating with external and internal parties and stakeholders on the ESD's areas of accountability and responsibility; 3.2.7 carrying out risk scenario analysis and regularly conducting horizon scanning for regulatory (and other) changes related to climate change; and 3.2.8 championing and overseeing that company targets and objectives align with climate, ESG and environmental targets as outlined in the company's constitutional documents. 3.3 A non-exhaustive list of the documents that are relevant to giving effect to clauses 3.1 and 3.2 include: 3.3.1 constitutional documents (for example, voting rules and board reserved matters); 3.3.2 Board member/ director contract of appointment; 3.3.3 human resources policy; 3.3.4 role description; 3.3.5 Board skills matrix; and 3.3.6 equity and diversity committee charter. 4. Form of the appointment to ESD 4.1 The form of the ESD appointment should consider the following: 4.1.1 defining any specific director duties that apply depending on jurisdiction and company type; 4.1.2 defining the form of the director role;* 4.1.3 determining and applying statutory and compliance standards as necessary; and 4.1.4 considering recommendations for appropriately qualified appointees from advisory committees/ organisations in the relevant jurisdiction/ sector (with ultimate discretion resting with the Board/ shareholders). * ; also OECD, G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2015) pp.50 & 52.). Benefits of having independent directors are that they should: (i) bring a more objective view since they are more likely to deliver unbiased judgements and ideas, (ii) provide the company with new knowledge and additional competencies, since they often represent access to external resources otherwise unavailable to the company, and (ii) be the balancing element among the different shareholders' interests and visions (L Pirolo, ‘Corporate Boards', in Corporate Governance and Diversity in Boardrooms: Empirical Insights into the Impact on Firm Performance (Palgrave Macmillan: 2021) pp.5-33. Available to download here ). ] 4.2 A non-exhaustive list of the documents that are relevant to the form of appointment of the ESD includes: 4.2.1 company charter/ articles of association; 4.2.2 shareholders' agreement; and 4.2.3 human resources policy. 5. Definition of ‘Indigenous' and ‘Indigenous Peoples/ Person' 5.1 This section 5 proposes options for how to define Indigenous or Indigenous Peoples/ Person in a contract or corporate governance documentation. [ See United Nations permanent forum on indigenous issues, Factsheet: Who are indigenous peoples? ] 5.1.1 Indigenous means a state of vulnerability that coalesces on a struggle for recognition of a special way of life. That specificity is characterised by the traditional ownership of land, a cultural and often spiritual attachment to land and the natural resource thereon and, related to this, a unique type of discrimination experienced in ongoing processes of dispossession. [ K Bhatt, Concessionaires, Financiers and Communities: Implementing Indigenous Peoples' Rights to Land in Transnational Development Projects (Cambridge University Press, 2020). ] 5.1.2 Indigenous Peoples or Indigenous Person means an individual or group of individuals that are [or identify as] Indigenous. 5.2 A non-exhaustive list of documents to use these defined terms in includes: 5.2.1 company charter; 5.2.2 human resources policy; and 5.2.3 diversity policy. 6. Preference for the ESD role to be filled by an Indigenous Person with specific skills and knowledge 6.1 The preference to appoint an Indigenous person to the ESD role is based on extensive research conducted by governments and international organisations worldwide. The research and lived experience have demonstrated that by contributing direct, beneficial, and fundamental understanding and experience to climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, Indigenous knowledge and culture (in the widest sense) are critical to tackling the impacts of climate change. 6.2 A non-exhaustive list of documents to use this template wording in includes: 6.2.1 company charter (board composition); 6.2.2 human resources policy; 6.2.3 diversity policy; and 6.2.4 ESD role description. 7. Necessary experience, skills, knowledge and competencies required by the role 7.1 The level of experience, skill and knowledge required of the ESD will depend on the company's requirements and may include the following: 7.1.1 Experience: (a) Assessing climate/ environmental impacts. (b) Identifying risk scenarios. (c) Developing mitigation strategies. (d) Understanding related international and national policies. (e) Developing community expertise, including leadership roles in local communities. (f) Identifying relevant stakeholders at various levels of community (to national level, if applicable). (g) Planning stakeholder engagement, development, and management. 7.1.2 Skills: (a) Engaging with, consulting and managing a range of stakeholders. (b) Communicating effectively across all levels of an organisation from community to national level, as applicable. (c) Developing strategies to achieve climate targets aligned with organisational objectives (and where relevant, more general sustainability and biodiversity targets). (d) Forming value-driven, strategic collaborations and partnerships. (e) Understanding and capacity to represent an Indigenous common voice. 7.1.3 Knowledge: (a) Demonstrating a level of local and Indigenous knowledge. (b) Demonstrating traditional knowledge or possessing the knowledge of Indigenous peoples which includes: (i) knowledge of systems, practices and institutions; (ii) understanding of measures to protect lands and environment; and (iii) understanding and experience with collaborative partnerships. 7.1.4 Competencies: (a) Wisdom keeper. [ See Wisdom Keepers .] (b) Unique ways of knowing. (c) ESG competencies considered in the principles of governance and composition of governance body/ the Board (refer to ESG section in 8.2.1 below). (d) Succession planning – the Board Charter should allow for the appointment of either: (i) an interim ESD; or (ii) one or more of the members of the Advisory Board Committee to act in this capacity whilst a new appointment is made. 7.2 A non-exhaustive list of documents to use this template wording in includes: 7.2.1 company charter; 7.2.2 human resources policy; 7.2.3 diversity policy; 7.2.4 ESD role description; and 7.2.5 board skills matrix. 8. Corporate policies affected by the appointment of the ESD 8.1 Human resources policy (recruitment) The company should ensure that the recruitment process for all employees (including the development of job descriptions and terms of reference) avoids (so far as possible) conscious and unconscious bias. To this end, the ESD or another Indigenous representative should be consulted about and engage with firm-wide recruitment processes. 8.2 Environmental, Social and Governance 8.2.1 The composition of the highest governance body and its committees ought to be considered in terms of ESG principles of governance: (a) Economic, environmental, and social topics; (b) Executive or non-executive; (c) Independence; (d) Tenure on the governance body; (e) Number of each individual's other significant positions and commitments and the nature of the commitments; (f) Gender; (g) Membership of under-represented social groups; and (h) Stakeholder representation. [ WEF, Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism: Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation (Sept 2020). ] 8.3 Diversity policy 8.3.1 Diversity targets for the appointment of Indigenous Peoples to the board are: (a) Indigenous appointments to board; (b) [specify target/ period]; (c) Gender of the appointee; (d) [proportionality best practice]; (e) Type of appointment (refer to the form of appointment); (f) [specify according to charter/ board composition requirements]; (g) Compliance with climate governance best practice; and (h) [specify compliance targets/ goals]. 8.3.2 Documents that might be relevant to give effect to the diversity targets above include: (a) Diversity policy; (b) Human resources policy; (c) Charter (board composition); and (d) Equity and diversity committee charter.

Decide whether to sign up to Race to Zero Signing up to Race to Zero requires the Company to: a) pledge to reach net zero as soon as possible (by 2050 at latest) in line with efforts to limit warming to 1.5C and set an interim target to achieve in the next decade, which reflects maximum effort towards or beyond 50 percent emissions reduction by 2030; b) within 12 months of joining Race to Zero, develop a plan of short- to medium-term actions to achieve interim and longer-term pledges; c) proceed with immediate action toward achieving targets; and d) publish (at least annually) the Company's progress against its interim and long-term targets, as well as the actions being taken. Companies that join through the SME Climate Hub can access a simplified reporting process appropriate to SMEs. 8. Monitor, evaluate and report on the Company's net-zero journey a) Establish a robust monitoring system to quantify GHG emissions and assess how the business is performing against its targets (see ‘measurement' above). b) Consider whether to have the Company's performance against its targets and Company emissions reductions audited by an independent third party. c) Be aware of innovation, legal, regulatory, technical or political developments that may help the Company achieve its targets more quickly. C. Implement targets? 9. Start with areas of the business within the Company's control. See the Net Zero Toolkit website and UK Business Climate Hub for tools and resources to assist with planning (from minimising waste, to talking to suppliers, setting targets and building a strategy). 10. Evaluate the current position of the business, practical action we can take now and its financial impact. Consider changes that might be needed in the longer term (for example, product design, technological shifts, changes to suppliers, growth strategies). a) Electricity suppliers List the Company's electricity suppliers Identify how many are renewable electricity suppliers and ways to adjust each Set a target date for the company's transition to 100 percent renewable electricity. See POW Pledge Guide for businesses switching to renewable electricity and Business Green Energy Comparison | Big Clean Switch ). b) Non-renewable fuel use List all non-renewable fuel suppliers. Establish a plan to replace them. Review the financial and operational implications of changing fuel suppliers (including likely increases to taxes on fossil fuels). Set a target date for running the company on 100 percent renewable fuel. See The Carbon Trust guide to energy saving opportunities ). c) Zero emission vehicle fleet Consider ways to reduce travel (for example video conferencing, location of warehouses, processes for deliveries). Switch to greener travel alternatives (for example trains rather than flights). In relation to the high emitting vehicles that need to be retained by the Company, set a timeframe within which to switch to zero-emission vehicles (there may be incentives for green vehicles and charging points). (See Transport advice for businesses - Energy Saving Trust ). Consider how the Company can encourage others (like customers, suppliers and staff) to use zero-emission vehicles? Use contracts and policies to mandate and incentivise others to use zero-emissions vehicles. [ Refer to The Chancery Lane Project's best practice guides how to integrate climate obligations into contracts and how to incentivise decarbonisation through contracts for a range of options]. d) Other avoidable GHG emissions Make a list of all other activities the business directly controls that emit GHGs (freight, product footprint, supplier buildings, supplier operations, staff and customer travel, customer activities and so on). Estimate the carbon footprint of each activity (using a tool such as The Carbon Trust's SME Carbon Footprint Calculator ). Identify where the Company needs to reduce emissions (such as reducing air miles or the carbon footprint of materials and packaging). Create a plan to measure and reduce emissions. e) Start or continue planning the reconfiguration of the business in light of the climate crisis, to cover medium- to long-term mitigation of the risks identified, and focusing on business resilience, financial gains and losses in particular. 11. Encourage others to begin or continue their journey to net zero. a) Supply chain: List suppliers that each make up at least [10 (ten)] percent of the Company's annual spend (or, if none, the Company's largest suppliers by annual expenditure). Work with Company procurement teams to build net-zero commitments and climate action in procurement policies. Include emissions-reduction terms in contracts with suppliers. Consider implementing policy documents that can be shared with third parties. b) Investments: List financial institutions that the Company transacts with (banks, insurers, investments such as pensions). Request information on how their investment policies align with Paris Agreement goals and the extent of any investment in high-emitting sectors or fossil fuels. Consider switching to Share Action approved providers; and (if relevant) set target date for disinvestment. c) Lobbying and campaigning: Consider if the Company should support campaigns or research aimed at tackling the climate crisis. Consider if the Company should engage in climate positive lobbying of government, policy makers and influencers. Review the Company's current trade associations and policy positions to ensure alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement. d) Employee (and contractor) engagement Consider opportunities for training staff on their role in helping the Company meet its net-zero targets and transition to net zero. Consider how to engage staff in the Company's net-zero journey so that they can play an active role in it. 12. Implement and communicate Company strategy internally and externally. We need to avoid greenwashing - that is, marketing our net-zero initiatives in a manner that is not supported by evidence. It is important to get buy-in at all levels of the Company to deliver meaningful change. Consider the following: a) How will we embed our net-zero targets into our corporate strategy? b) Do we need to amend our constitutional documents to embed climate into the purpose and articles of the Company, for example our articles of association? c) Should the board consider the environmental impact of its decisions as a standard consideration in all executive decision making? d) Are there internal or external policies we can introduce to help us meet our net-zero targets (net-zero aligned procurement policies, terms and conditions for suppliers in our supply chain, clauses we want to include as standard in our contracts)? e) How best to share our climate ambition, objectives and targets with internal and external stakeholders. f) Stakeholder management best practice and how the Company can optimise stakeholder buy-in. g) What public disclosures should we make about our climate ambition and performance against our net-zero objectives and targets? How should we communicate these, to whom and how often? h) How will our transparency on climate affect customer loyalty and brand image? i) Can we partner with our clients to encourage them to also take climate positive action to decarbonise and set their own net-zero targets on their journey to a net-zero future?

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that writes legal clauses."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please write me a legal clause that could be integrated into a contract for Net Zero Whistleblowing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Whistleblowing regime for Climate-Related Issues 1.1 To show our commitment to these objectives and policy [we have established a whistleblowing regime][we will incorporate Climate–Related Issues into our existing whistleblowing regime] for [employees, workers, volunteers, interns[,][and] business partners [and suppliers]*]. * 1.2 This regime will provide a contact for the whistleblower, who can make reports anonymously if they wish to do so.* [The whistleblower may seek advice and support from the company's whistle-blowing champion [who will maintain the anonymity of the whistleblower unless the whistleblower requests otherwise]]. * 1.3 Following receipt of the information by the contact, an internal assessment and investigation will be conducted by [ appropriate individual(s) identified in accordance with the ‘Reporting channels' guidelines below ]. 1.4 If the conclusion of the investigation is that there is credit to the report it will be reported to the board of the company. [1.5 Regardless of whether the report is found to be creditable and conveyed to the board of the company pursuant to clause 1.4, the contact shall: (a) notify the whistleblower promptly of the conclusion of the internal assessment and investigation; and (b) [where the company deems reasonable] respond promptly and in reasonable detail to any enquiries the whistleblower may have about the internal assessment and investigation, provided such enquiries are not malicious, abusive or frivolous [and are made within [10 business days] of its conclusion].] 1.6 Unless a report is malicious, abusive or frivolous, the making of a report will result in no retaliation and will have no negative effect on the whistleblower's career. Guidelines and considerations for implementing the whistleblowing regime Reporting channels: Specify the reporting modes available to whistleblowers and consider how to provide the option of anonymous reporting and/ or a whistleblowing champion. It may be that this is included in the company's current whistleblowing policy with a warning that although the company will encourage such reports, they may not fall within protection afforded by the local legislation on whistleblowing. Determine the most suitable person(s) (who will be given training) for the receipt and treatment of internal reports. In larger companies, this would likely be the audit committee or a steering committee, with such committees then reporting regularly to the board. Alternatives could be, for example, compliance officers, legal counsel, or such processing can be outsourced. The reporting channels should be clearly and regularly communicated to all staff and business partners. Acknowledging reports and providing updates: The EU Whistleblowing Directive requires that whistleblowers be informed of the receipt of their report within seven days and of any action taken (including the status outcome of the internal investigation) within three months. Companies are not bound by the Directive and it should be considered whether to reduce the time frame for initial acknowledgement (for example, to 1-2 business days), or for providing reports on the status of the outcome. Specify these timeframes in the whistleblowing policy and procedure. It is worth noting that, depending on the outcome of the investigation, it may not be appropriate to provide details on the outcome of the investigation other than to note that the whistleblower's concerns were found to have grounding and that action was being taken. Training: Training workers regularly on how the whistleblowing regime works and its process and features is crucial. Workers need to know that the whistleblowing regime is an option available to them and that they are encouraged to use it, if appropriate. Training can be part of all employee on-boarding, and also be provided to business partners, with regular communications to remind the relevant stakeholders of the policy. Identifying reportable breaches: Consider what situations would breach the company's stated net zero policy and provide tangible examples in stakeholder training, such that they may be able to identify a similar reportable situation if it occurs. If for example the company has a commitment to working with suppliers with certain green credentials as part of its net zero policy, and a stakeholder becomes aware that the company is working with a supplier that does not in fact meet these credentials that could form the basis of a report. Consider using real-life scenarios in training (anonymised), to make the examples more accessible. [ Whistleblower reward: consider whether you would like to incentivise employee/ stakeholder buy-in through a reward, appropriate to the size and nature of your business. This could be a small financial reward, a voucher or a non-financial reward such as, for example, the opportunity to attend external training or something of value to the relevant stakeholder. This should be considered in light of any incentives given with regard to any other whistleblowing policy.] Transparency : The net zero whistleblowing reports received and actions taken in response to any whistleblower's information investigated and reported should be reported regularly to the Board, and made available to other stakeholders (consider also making publicly available). What constitutes \"regular\" will differ on a case by case basis, but will likely be no less than annually. Whistleblower anonymity must be preserved. Regime statistics: Consider collecting statistics on the number of net zero whistleblowing reports made and using those statistics to measure the effectiveness of the policy's implementation (consider also making them publicly available). A small number of reports can indicate that there are no (or very few) breaches. However, receiving no reports at all may also indicate that potential whistleblowers do not know the policy exists or do not feel comfortable using it. Safe storage of reports: Reports must be safely and confidentially stored, such as by using an information barrier. [END]"}]}
