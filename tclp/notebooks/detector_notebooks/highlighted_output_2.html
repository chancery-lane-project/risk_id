The model uses multiple national and local data sets to build up a granular building-by-building understanding of the likely heating demand, heat supply opportunities and routing constraints within each area.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>It then applies a range of national and local assumptions used widely across the industry to understand where heat networks are likely to meet the lowest cost, low carbon test outlined above.</span><br><br>It uses a set of algorithms to perform calculations and optimise solutions at scale which would otherwise take months to generate manually.<br><br>.4.

The NZM, which supports the identification of heat network zones, is one of six key heat network zoning workstreams led by DESNZ.<br><br>The NZM is a data-led spatial energy model developed by the Centre for Sustainable Energy for DESNZ to identify indicative heat network zones across England.<br><br>The NZM provides granular outputs which, when supplemented with local data, will identify areas that may be taken forward for refinement and, subsequently, designation as heat network zones.<br><br>This is described in more detail in previous procurement 2.3. The original aims of the NZM, as written in 2021, are as follows: enable a standardised approach for setting heat network zones that is robust, transparent and minimises duplication of effort;  provide a consistent foundation for the use of national policy levers to support heat network development within designated zones;  reduce the burden on local actors by virtue of following a standard approach as opposed to designing a new approach each time; and  provide a common architecture which allows for the methodology to be updated as and when new assumptions, parameters, carbon targets or Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 National Zoning Model – Lot 3.1 Scope of Works 2.4. The National Zoning Model is one of six interrelated workstreams that make up the Heat Network Zoning Transformation Programme(HNZTP).<br><br>This programme aims to prepare for the introduction of heat network zoning in 2025. The programme consists of several workstreams, described below: Legislation:Establish the HN Zoning Policy; with defined statutory roles & responsibilities that enable subsequent delivery of HNZs at desired scale  National HNZ Modelling:Develop a robust HNZ identification model, and establish DESNZ capability to continually assure, support and operate the  Digital:Develop an online digital service to provide HNZ information to stakeholders including the visualisation of the HNZ identification model  Routes to Market:Develop standards routes to market for the zone delivery procurement/appointment approach by Zone Co-ordinators  Advanced Zoning Programme:Undertake development work to support delivery of at least 10 zonal scale HNs in 2025 aligned with the HN Zoning  Central Authority/Zone Co-ordinator:Explore the capability of establishing a Central Authority/Zone Co-ordinators(including functions, responsibilities, roles & step-in powers)2.5. The scope of the model is England, as heat policy is devolved.<br><br>To date, the model and its outputs have been shared with a range of stakeholders including 28 towns & cities participating in the HNZ Pilot Programme, HNDU feasibility studies, the Advanced Zoning Programme, the Greater London Authority’s sub-regional Local Area Energy Plans and for underpinning DESNZ’ heat network growth and 2.6. It is envisaged that the model outputs will fully integrate with the new digital service ready for MVP launch during this contract period in 2025. As we move into the operational phase of HN Zoning, we have tried to envisage the likely tasks that will be required in relation to the model development but our experience shows that greater exposure of the model’s outputs can often generate new requirements for the workstream and therefore it is likely that priorities may change over the period of the contract.<br><br>2.7.

The Department has developed the NZM as part of the Heat Networks Zoning Pilot Programme, utilising a specialist team with experience in heat networks, software development and energy modelling, along with input from local authorities and the department’s Heat Networks Delivery Unit.<br><br>The model uses of a range of data sources, processing, and optimisation to identify indicative Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 National Zoning Model – Lot 3.1 Scope of Works 2.14. The modelling stages are described in more detail below:Data led mapping:the model uses a range of data sources to construct a data-rich map of individual building heat demands, potential pipe routes, potential low carbon heat supply opportunities and geographical features that Lowest cost, low-carbon options evaluated:the model evaluates the lowcarbon options for each building – a low-carbon heat network and an individual building air source heat pump – by combining the mapped data with a standard set of assumptions about technology costs and performance.<br><br>The model uses an iterative optimisation algorithm to find the lowest cost combination of Air Source Heat Pumps and heat networks in an area, which subsequently identifies a suggested heating solution for each building.<br><br>The model repeats the optimisation process using a range of scenarios for the price of heat provided to the distribution network – the“heat price scenarios”– and generates a range of solutions for each building.<br><br>In later stages, the model will match heat demand to available heat sources to identify the largest potential heat network based on the cost of heat.<br><br>Zone shapes produced:The model discards areas that do not contain any modelled network and combines adjoining areas in the same price scenario to Candidate zones produced:The model connects every zone shape to a heat source provided to the model if the cost of heat from the source is lower than the heat price scenario.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>This creates many instances which could become Indicative zones selected:Candidate zones may overlap or compete for a single heat source.</span><br><br>The model sorts all candidate zones by size and by economic potential.<br><br>It selects the top configuration as the first indicative heat network zone and removes any other candidate zones which compete for a heat source or overlap spatially.<br><br>This process continues for the next largest zone until all candidate zones have been selected or discarded.<br><br>Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 National Zoning Model – Lot 3.1 Scope of Works 7.

improving the pace of production and user acceptance of outputs.<br><br>Feature Development:further develop model functionality to add to the existing modelled characteristics; improve the quality of outputs; and align Data Integration:integrate new datasets from multiple sources to improve the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underpinning data Quality Assurance:achieve/maintain

of indicative heat network zones for England, ready to be published on a digital service(being developed by a separate workstream).<br><br>The outputs must be produced by a model which has passed DESNZ QA processes, proportional to the scale of the decisions guided by the modelling outputs.<br><br>4.2 This scope of works is split into four key work packages which support the aims Work Package 1:Hosting & National Model Runs Work Package 2:Feature Development Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 Schedule 2(Specification), Crown Copyright 2023, [Subject to Contract]Work Package 3:Data Integration and Work Package 1:Hosting & National Model Runs Host the NZM on appropriate cloud infrastructure, undertake frequent National Model Runs(NMRs)until March 2026 to test, improve and enhance our ability to model indicative heat network zones across England.<br><br>One key deliverable for the NZM workstream is NMRs – a set of outputs from a Quality Assured model identifying indicative zones for England.<br><br>These outputs will be the basis of later activities carried out at a local level to refine and designate zones across the country.<br><br>To date, three NMRs have been completed to establish and develop the modelling capability to do so within a reasonable timeframe.<br><br>It is anticipated that two further NMRs will be undertaken before December 2024 and then quarterly until the end of this contract.<br><br>These NMRs will be completed to further develop the modelling and surrounding processes, as well as to understand the impact of

into 37 separate modelling segments, delineated by corridors of lowest heat demand – i.e. areas in which we would not expect to find any heat networks and therefore will not impact the model’s ability to consider cross boundary(district, local or regional)heat networks.<br><br>These are then stitched together to create an NMR.<br><br>We expect this to remain the approach for the duration of the contract.<br><br>The modelling segments are Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 Schedule 2(Specification), Crown Copyright 2023, [Subject to Contract]less than the computing costs of undertaking a complete NMR(~2 weeks and £6, 000).<br><br>The rationale for choosing these two segments is provided below:The North London Model Segment comprises 1.3m buildings, with c.<br><br>37TWh of heat demand of which 10TWh(28%)is currently identified as suitable for heat networks within 85 zones.<br><br>The southern edge of the segment is bounded by the River Thames, the northern edge broadly follows either the northern edge of outer London Boroughs or the M25 motorway.<br><br>This segment includes one of the largest zones identified within the National Zoning Model and often has a wide range of variability, with inner London influencing ‘zones’ identified in outer London, and therefore is a suitable candidate for this commission.<br><br>The Midlands Model Segment comprises 900, 000 buildings, with c.<br><br>16TWh of heat demand of which 3TWh(20%)is currently identified as suitable for heat networks within 121 zones.<br><br>It covers large proportions of Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire.<br><br>This segment includes large cities(including Coventry and Leicester), rural areas, a variety of heavy and light industrial sites and multiple health and educational campuses.<br><br>It is representative of the overall % of heat network deployment across England Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 Schedule 2(Specification), Crown Copyright 2023, [Subject to Contract](20%)and is familiar to the NZM Workstream Lead.<br><br>Since the outset, it has often been used to test the model features before being run at a national level and is therefore a suitable candidate for this commission.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>Operational model runs:Once the zoning policy goes ‘live’, it is expected that the local Zone Co-ordinators will collect local data into a file that can be ingested by the National Zoning Model.</span><br><br>This process has already been tested as part of the Heat Network Zoning Pilot Programme and Advanced Zoning Programme.<br><br>It is envisaged that between 2-5 Model Input Data templates(MIDs)will be submitted on average per month for the duration of the contract.<br><br>Once received, the model will be required to be re-run for the segment containing the Zone Co-ordinator’s own boundary.<br><br>Ad-hoc local model runs:Occasionally, DESNZ will require the model to be run for other purposes to support other workstreams within the Heat Network Zoning Transition Programme.<br><br>This may include using the model to a)apply external third-party research to the NZM, such as changing sensitivities, cost Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 Schedule 2(Specification), Crown Copyright 2023, [Subject to Contract]parameters or

with these requests in the Other model runs:For all other model requests, we intend to share the most complete and acceptable NMR available at the time of request, to reduce workload for this

We aim to publish our consultation response to the second consultation in Summer 2024. It is at this point that we expect the final policy positions to be known.<br><br>Until this date, it is likely that some of the key requirements of the model functionality may evolve and/or change and therefore it’s important that bidders understand that the National Zoning Model workstream will need to adapt to policy changes to ensure that the modelling remains consistent with the latest policy intent.<br><br>Despite this we have a good understanding of the likely requirements that will be needed, the budget and Alongside the development of the Heat Network Zoning Policy, BEIS trialled an initial approach to identifying zones as part of the City Decarbonisation Delivery Programme(CDDP).<br><br>This adapted Centre for Sustainable Energy’s THERMOS model to identify potential zones in six cities across England(Birmingham, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and Nottingham).<br><br>Zoning was based on a data-driven viability assessment, with refinement from key strategic local stakeholders in each city.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>The previous Enable a standardised approach for setting heat network zones that is robust, transparent and minimises duplication of effort; Provide a consistent foundation for the use of national policy levers to support heat network development within designated zones; Reduce the burden on local actors by virtue of following a standard approach as opposed to designing a new approach each time; and Provide a common architecture which allows for the methodology to be updated as and when new assumptions, parameters, carbon targets or policies are introduced.</span><br><br>Heat Network Zoning Transition Programme The National Zoning Model is one of six interrelated workstreams that make up the Heat Network Zoning Transformation Programme(HNZTP).<br><br>This programme aims to prepare for the introduction of heat network zoning in 2025.

also support the identification of zones within the Advanced Zoning Programme(AZP).<br><br>The programme is working with 19 cities across England to accelerate the delivery of zonal-scale heat networks as part of the Government’s ambition to supply 20% of heat through heat networks by 2050 to enable the UK to reach net zero.<br><br>The cities that are part of AZP have been identified as those which are further developed around their planning and thinking of heat network development and are ready to deliver at pace and scale.<br><br>AZP is supporting the development of best practice guidance, providing project development support services, and promoting market transformation ready for national heat Additionally, the outputs are being used to underpin other work within the Department such as the development of a potential Heat Networks Strategy and also inform an implementation strategy being developed by the Central Authority.<br><br>DESNZ will manage the interactions between these programmes as part of this tender.<br><br>NZM & Lifecycle of a Heat Network Zones As set out in the second consultation, a heat network zone has several stages during which different bodies will carry out specific actions.<br><br>The first stage of the zoning methodology is the identification of indicative heat network zones across England by the Central Authority.<br><br>This will be carried out using the National Zoning Model.<br><br>Therefore, it is essential that the Department has a fully Quality Assured MVP National Zoning Model for the policy launch date as it is the first stage in the process.<br><br>The second part of the zoning methodology is the refinement of the indicative heat network zones.<br><br>Both the Central Authority and the relevant Zone Coordinator will review the outputs of the model to check for accuracy.<br><br>Where appropriate, they will collect additional data to ensure that the indicative zones have been identified using the most accurate information.<br><br>The NZM is a data-led spatial energy model developed by the Centre for Sustainable Energy for DESNZ to identify indicative heat network zones across England.<br><br>The NZM provides granular outputs which, when supplemented with local data, will identify areas that may be taken forward for refinement and, subsequently, designation as heat network zones.<br><br>The department has developed the NZM as part of the Heat Networks Zoning Pilot Programme, utilising a specialist team with experience in heat networks, software development and energy modelling, along with input from local authorities and the Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 Schedule 2(Specification), Crown Copyright 2023, [Subject to Contract]department’s Heat Networks Delivery Unit.<br><br>The model uses of a range of data sources, processing, and optimisation to identify potential zones as shown below:These stages in the model are described in more detail below:Data led mapping:the model uses a range of data sources to construct a data-rich map of individual building heat demand, potential pipe routes, and geographical features that may Lowest cost, low-carbon options evaluated:the model evaluates the low-carbon options for each building – a low-carbon heat network and an individual building air source heat pump – by combining the mapped data with a standard set of assumptions about technology The model uses an iterative optimisation algorithm to find the lowest cost combination of Air Source Heat Pumps and heat networks in an area, which subsequently identifies a suggested heating solution for each building.<br><br>The model repeats the optimisation process using a range of scenarios for the price of heat provided to the distribution network – the“heat price scenarios”– and generates a range of solutions for each building.<br><br>In later stages, the model will match heat demand to available heat sources to identify the largest potential heat network based on the cost of heat.<br><br>We know that many stakeholders will be interested in the outputs of the NZM.<br><br>The model, and its outputs, will therefore need to be clearly communicated to a range of stakeholders, including local government, building developers and owners, to support local refinement and designation.<br><br>We will continue to refine the model and develop the underlying evidence to Zone shapes produced:The model discards areas that do not contain a network and combines adjoining areas in the same price scenario to create“zone shapes”.<br><br>Candidate zones produced:The model connects every zone shape to a heat source provided to the model if the cost of heat from the source is lower than the heat price scenario.<br><br>This creates many instances which could become zones, called“candidate zones”.<br><br><span style='background-color: yellow;'>Indicative zones selected:Candidate zones may overlap or compete for a single heat source.</span><br><br>The model sorts all candidate zones by size and by economic potential.<br><br>It selects the top configuration as the first indicative heat network zone and removes any other candidate zones which compete for a heat source or overlap spatially.<br><br>This process continues for the next largest zone until all candidate zones have been selected or discarded.<br><br>The National Zoning Model has been primarily developed by the Centre for Sustainable Energy.<br><br>The purpose of the model is to support the initial identification of heat network zones.<br><br>The model is highly parameterised and flexible:what a zone is, and what properties a zone must have, depend on what values entered for parameters.<br><br>The NZM contains the following 8 main modules:Docusign Envelope ID:89C377CB-B239-4094-B128-F52236F2D0E3 Schedule 2(Specification), Crown Copyright 2023, [Subject to Contract].<br><br>Dig categorisation model:assigns each road a
