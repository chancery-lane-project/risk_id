that the End User Warranty statement included with Equipment is passed through with the Equipment to End Users. The End User Warranty statement shipped with Equipment will specify the terms and
conditions of SGI's then-current End User Warranty (as of the date when the Equipment is originally packed and shipped by SGI). Medtronic acknowledges that SGI reserves the right to amend
the terms
and conditions of the End User Warranty from time to time. If SGI changes the terms and conditions of its standard End User Warranty, such change shall not affect the End User Warranty on Equipment
