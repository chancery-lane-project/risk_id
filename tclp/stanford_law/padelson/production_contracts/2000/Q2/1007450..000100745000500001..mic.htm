<P ALIGN="CENTER">MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">GENERAL PROXY INFORMATION</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solicitation of Proxies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;This management information circular (the "Circular") is being furnished to the shareholders of Versent Corporation ("Versent") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the directors and management of Versent for
use at the annual meeting of the shareholders of Versent (the "Meeting") to be held in Versent's boardroom located at 3269 American Drive, Mississauga, Ontario on Wednesday, June 21, 2000, at the hour of ten o'clock in the morning, Mississauga time,
called for the purposes set out in the notice of the Meeting accompanying this Circular.  Unless otherwise stated, information contained in this Circular is given as of the date hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The solicitation of proxies for the Meeting will be primarily by mail but proxies may also be solicited personally or by telephone by employees of Versent.  Employees of Versent will not receive any extra compensation for such
activities. Versent may also pay brokers or other persons holding common shares of Versent in their own names, or in the names of nominees, for their reasonable expenses for sending proxies and proxy material to beneficial owners of common shares of
Versent and requesting authority to execute proxies in respect of such common shares of Versent. Versent will bear the expenses of the solicitation of proxies by the directors and management of Versent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;No person is authorized to give any information or to make any representation other than as contained in this Circular and, if given or made, such information or representation should not be relied upon as having been
authorized by Versent.  The delivery of this Circular shall not under any circumstances create an implication that there has been no change in the information set forth herein since the date of this Circular.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Appointment of Proxy and Discretionary Authority</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The persons named in the form of proxy accompanying this Circular are officers and/or directors of Versent.  <B>A shareholder of Versent has the right to appoint a person, who need not be a shareholder of Versent, other
than the persons named in the form of proxy accompanying this Circular, as nominee to attend and act for and on behalf of such shareholder at the Meeting and may exercise such right by inserting the name of such person in the blank space provided on the
form of proxy, or by executing a proxy in a form similar to the form of proxy, accompanying this Circular.  If a shareholder of Versent appoints one of the persons named in the form of proxy accompanying this Circular as the nominee of the shareholder and
does not direct such nominee to vote either for or against or withhold from voting on a matter or matters with respect to which an opportunity to specify how the common shares of Versent registered in the name of such shareholder are to be voted, the
proxy shall be voted for such matter or matters.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;To be effective, forms of proxy must be received by Versent c/o CIBC Mellon Trust Company, 200 Queens Quay East, Unit 6, Toronto, Ontario  M5A 4K9, Attention:  Proxy Department, prior to 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, on Monday,
June 19, 2000, or, in the case of any adjournment of the Meeting, not later than 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, two business days prior to the date of the reconvened meeting.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exercise of Vote by Proxy </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The common shares of Versent represented by a proxy at the Meeting will be voted for or against or withheld from voting in accordance with the instructions of the shareholder of such common shares of Versent, so long as
such instructions are certain, on any ballot that may be called for and, where the shareholder of Versent whose proxy is solicited specifies a choice with respect to any matter to be voted upon, the common shares of Versent represented by such proxy will
be voted in accordance with the specification so made.  <B>If no choice is specified in the proxy, the persons named in the form of proxy accompanying this Circular will vote for all of the matters proposed by management at the Meeting and described in the notice of the Meeting accompanying this Circular.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The form of proxy accompanying this Circular confers discretionary authority upon the persons named therein with respect to any amendment or variation to the matters identified in the notice of the Meeting accompanying this
Circular and with respect to other matters which may properly come before the Meeting.  Management of Versent knows of no matters to come before the Meeting other than those referred to in the notice of the Meeting accompanying this Circular.  However, if
any other matters which are not now known to management of Versent should properly come before the Meeting, the common shares of Versent represented by proxies given in favour of the persons named in the form of proxy accompanying this Circular will be
voted on such matters in accordance with the best judgment of such person.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revocation of Proxies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;A shareholder of Versent may revoke a previously given proxy by depositing an instrument in writing signed by the shareholder or an attorney authorized by a document signed in writing or by electronic signature (if the
shareholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal by an officer or attorney thereof properly authorized, indicating the capacity under which such officer or attorney is signing), or by transmitting, by telephonic or electronic means, a revocation
signed by electronic signature, or by any other manner permitted by law, which must be received either at the registered office of Versent at any time up to and including 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, two business days prior to the date of the Meeting, or any
adjournment thereof, at which the proxy is to be used, or with the chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Voting Securities and Principal Holders Thereof</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Board of Directors of Versent (the &quot;Board&quot;) has fixed May 12, 2000 as the record date for determining those shareholders of Versent entitled to receive notice of the Meeting, but the failure of any shareholder
of Versent to receive a notice of the Meeting does not deprive the shareholder of a vote at the Meeting.  If a person has acquired common shares of Versent after May 12, 2000, that person is entitled to vote those shares at the Meeting upon producing
properly endorsed share certificates or otherwise establishing share ownership, and demanding in writing the inclusion of such person's name on the list of shareholders of Versent entitled to vote at the Meeting not later than 10 days before the Meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;As of May 12, 2000 9,388,343 common shares of Versent were outstanding, each entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Meeting.  Each holder of record of common shares of Versent on May 12, 2000 was entitled
to notice of the Meeting and is entitled to vote at the Meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The following table sets out, as at May 12, 2000, each person who is known to the senior officers or directors of Versent to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, or to exercise control or direction over, more than 10% of
the outstanding common shares of Versent:</P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;As at May 12, 2000 the officers and directors of Versent as a group beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, or exercised control or direction over 9,300 common shares representing less than 0.1% of the
aggregate number of common shares of Versent then outstanding.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interests of Insiders in Material Transactions</P>
</B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Starburst</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effective May 4, 1999, Versent sold all of its shares (the &quot;Starburst Sale Transaction&quot;) in Starburst Coin Machines Inc. (&quot;Starburst&quot;) to a Starburst management group led by Mr. Leonard Keywood (&quot;
Keywood&quot;), the founder and only President of Starburst, for $6,807,993. The shares were purchased with a combination of cash and the delivery of a Promissory Note from Starburst. The Promissory Note is secured by a second charge on the assets of
Starburst and is personally guaranteed by Keywood.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Board decided to sell Starburst for a number of reasons, including, corporate culture incompatibility, eroding earnings, difficult industry conditions and Versent's commitment to reduce its term debt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Starburst Sale Transaction resulted in a loss of $4,892,781 being incurred which has been reflected in Versent's 1999 year end financial results. On a going forward basis, the elimination of Starburst from Versent's holdings will
result in reduced revenue, profits and EBITDA, but little change in net free cashflow. Given that Versent and Starburst have entered into a long term supply agreement for coin operated amusement machines, there will be no disruption to Versent's core
Laser Quest business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From its incorporation in 1987 until June 1996, Starburst was owned and operated by Keywood. On June 13, 1996, all of the shares of Starburst were purchased by Versent. Since that time, Keywood continued to be a director of Starburst
as well as its President. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of Starburst Sale Transaction were reviewed and approved by the Board and Versent's principal lender. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In evaluating the Starburst Sale Transaction, the Board took into account the book value of the shares of Starburst, the historical performance of Starburst, the future business prospects of Starburst and anticipated future industry
conditions. The Board and Versent's principal lender agreed that based on the Board's evaluation, the terms of the Starburst Sale Transaction were fair and reasonable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In completing the Starburst Sale Transaction, Versent relied on the exemption under Section 18.1 (5) of the Ontario Securities Commission Policy Statement No. 9.1 (Policy 9.1) from the valuation requirements and the exemption under
Section 20.2 (1) of Policy 9.1 from the minority approval requirements.</P>
<U><P>Chromacolour</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On March 16, 2000, Versent sold substantially all of the assets of Chromacolour International Limited, a UK company, to a company controlled jointly by Mr. David H. James, a director of Versent, and an unrelated partner for
$230,000 and the assumption of certain liabilities.  In addition, a company controlled jointly by Mr. James and a different unrelated partner on March 31, 2000 acquired substantially all of the assets of Chromacolour International Limited, an Ontario
corporation, for $125,000 and the assumption of certain liabilities (collectively the &quot;Chromacolour Sale Transactions&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Board decided to sell Chromacolour for a number of reasons, including the incurrence of mounting losses, difficult industry conditions, Versent's commitment to reduce its term debt and desire to re-focus on its core businesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to selling Chromacolour, the carrying value of the investment in Chromacolour had been written down $1,950,000 to approximately $350,000 in the December 31, 1999 financial statements, so the Chromacolour Sale Transactions did not
result in any further writedowns.  On a going forward basis, the elimination of Chromacolour from Versent's holdings will result in reduced revenue, but significant improvements in profits, EBITDA and net free cashflow. Given that Versent has completely
exited the Craft industry there will be no disruption to Versent's core businesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of Chromacolour Sale Transactions were reviewed and approved by the Board and Versent's principal lender. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In evaluating the Chromacolour Sale Transactions, the Board took into account the book value of the assets of Chromacolour, the historical performance of Chromacolour, the future business prospects of Chromacolour and anticipated

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;In May 1995, the TSE adopted a by-law requiring each listed company incorporated in Canada to provide annual disclosure of its approach to corporate governance with reference to the guidelines contained in a report (the
"TSE Report") prepared by The Toronto Stock Exchange Committee on Corporate Governance in Canada.  These guidelines address matters such as:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;-&#9;the mandate of the Board, including disclosure of who has responsibility for strategic planning, identifying the principal risks of Versent's business and implementing systems for managing these risks, succession planning,
communication policies, internal control and information systems;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;-&#9;the mandate and composition of board committees;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;-&#9;the constitution and independence of the Board and its committees, including the desirability of the majority of "unrelated directors", and of a nominating committee consisting of unrelated directors.  An "unrelated director"
is a director who is independent of management and is free from any interest in the business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director's ability to act with a view to the best interests
of Versent, other than interests and relationships arising from share holdings;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;-&#9;the size of the Board;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;-&#9;the adequacy and form of compensation of directors in light of risks and responsibilities; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;-&#9;the structures and procedures employed to ensure the Board functions independently of management.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Board has ultimate responsibility for the management of Versent including the development of a strategic plan, identifying and controlling the principal risks of Versent, developing communication policies and internal
control and management systems.  The responsibility of the Board is to oversee the conduct of Versent and to supervise management.  The Board met six times in 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The present Board consists of seven members, of whom the Board considers that five are outside directors and that four directors, Mr. Buckstein, Mr. Johnston, Ms Morrison, and Mr. Rosen, are unrelated directors, as such term is
defined above.  Accordingly, the Board is constituted with a majority of directors who qualify as "unrelated directors" within the meaning of the TSE Report.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The TSE Report suggests that independence of the Board is most simply achieved by appointing a chairman who is not a member of management.  As a non-executive Chairman, the Chairman of the Board is not considered a member of
management and the Board considers that it complies with the TSE Report.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The only committee of the Board is the Audit and Compensation Committee.  The Committee consists of three directors, being Mr. Buckstein, Mr. Johnston (Chairman), and Mr. Rosenkrantz, all of whom are outside directors and two
of whom, Mr. Buckstein and Mr. Johnston, are unrelated directors.  The Committee's main roles are to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of Versent's financial reporting and control systems, review financial statements and reports, oversee relations
with the auditors and assess the quality of Versent's financial staff.  In addition, the Committee reviews compensation policies and benefits and provides recommendations to the Board on compensation matters.   The Committee met four times in 1999.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Versent does not have a Nominating Committee or Corporate Governance Committee as suggested by the TSE Report due to the relative size of Versent.  Decisions with respect to succession planning, recruitment of new directors and
matters with respect to corporate governance are made by the Board as a whole.  The Board has determined to retain general responsibility for dealing with corporate governance issues, while maintaining the flexibility of asking certain committees of the
Board to address specific issues as they may arise from time to time.  Therefore, a Corporate Governance Committee will not be created at this time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Board considers that orienting and educating new directors is an important element of ensuring responsible corporate governance.  By ensuring that members of the Board are properly informed of the business of Versent, the
Board considers that it complies with the TSE Report.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &#9;&#9;There is no formal structure to ensure that the Board functions independently of management.  The Board believes that the segregation between management and the Board has been traditionally understood but not formalized.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Board has reviewed its size relative to other public companies and believes that the current size of the Board is appropriate to carry out its duties effectively and efficiently while presenting a diversity of views and
experience.  The Board has also reviewed its compensation and believes that it adequately reflects the responsibilities and risks involved in serving as directors and the size of Versent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for an individual director to engage an outside advisor at the expense of Versent.  The Chairman of the Board will determine if the circumstances warrant the engagement of an
outside advisor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Board has put structures in place to ensure effective communications between Versent, its shareholders and the public, including quarterly and annual reports and press releases.  All inquiries from the investment community
and shareholders of Versent are directed to the Vice-President, Finance and Secretary-Treasurer of Versent and are responded to promptly by the appropriate individual within Versent.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Board has approved the contents and the sending of this Circular.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The foregoing contains no untrue statement of a material fact and does not omit to state a material fact that is required to be stated or that is necessary to make a statement not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which it was made.</P>
