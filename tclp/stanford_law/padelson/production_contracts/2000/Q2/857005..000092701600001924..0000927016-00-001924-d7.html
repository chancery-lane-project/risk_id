 <P><FONT

   Company and the Officer hereby agree as follows:</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT
 FACE="Times New
   Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <U>Termination Notice</U>. The Company agrees that it may not terminate the
   employment of the Officer unless (i) such termination is for Cause (as
   defined below) or (ii) the Company has delivered to the Officer a written
   notice of such termination (the &quot;Termination Notice&quot;) at least six
   months in advance of the termination date. The duties of the Officer during
   the period from the date of delivery of a Termination Notice until the
   termination of his employment shall be as determined by the Board of
   Directors.</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT
 FACE="Times New
   Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <U>Salary</U>. During the period from the date of delivery of the
   Termination Notice (the &quot;Notice Date&quot;) until the earlier of (i)
   the date six months after the Notice Date or (ii) the date the Officer
   commences employment with another company or organization, the Company shall
   pay to the Officer a salary that is equal, on an annualized basis, to the
   highest annual salary (excluding any bonuses) in effect with respect to the
   Officer during the six-month period immediately preceding the Termination
   Notice.</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT
 FACE="Times New
   Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <U>Stock Options</U>. Effective upon a Change in Control (as defined below)
   of the Company, all stock options granted to the Officer and then
   outstanding under any Stock Option Plan (as defined below) of the Company
   shall become exercisable in full, notwithstanding any vesting schedule or
   other provisions to the contrary in the agreements evidencing such options;
   and the Company and the Officer hereby agree that such option agreements are
   hereby and will be deemed amended to give effect to this
   provision.</FONT></P>

   termination by the Company of the Officer's employment for &quot;Cause&quot;
   shall mean termination (i) for the Officer's willful and continued failure
   to substantially perform his duties to the Company (other than any such
   failure resulting from the Officer's incapacity due to physical or mental
   illness or any such actual or perceived failure after a Change in Status of
   the Officer), provided that (a) the Company has delivered a written demand
   for substantial performance to the Officer specifically identifying the
   manner in which the Company believes that</FONT></P>

 the Officer has not substantially performed his duties, and (b) the Officer
   has not cured such failure within 30 days after such demand, (ii) for
   willful conduct by the Officer which is demonstrably and materially
   injurious to the Company, or (iii) for the Officer's willful violation of
   any material provision of any confidentiality, nondisclosure, assignment of
   invention, noncompetition or similar agreement entered into by the Officer
   in connection with his employment by the Company. For purposes of this
   paragraph, no act or failure to act on the Officer's part shall be deemed
   &quot;willful&quot; unless done or omitted to be done by the Officer not in
   good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in
   the best interests of the Company.</FONT></P>

   Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
   representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then
   outstanding securities (other than as a result of acquisitions of such
   securities from the Company); (ii) individuals who, as of the date hereof,
   constitute the Board of Directors of the Company (the &quot;Incumbent
   Board&quot;) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the

   hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's
   stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
   then comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of
   an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an
   actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the
   directors of the Company) shall be, for purposes of this Agreement,
   considered to be a member of the Incumbent Board; (iii) the stockholders of
   the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other
   corporation, other than (A) a merger or consolidation which would result in
   the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto
   continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
   converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of
   the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such
   surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation
   or (B) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of
   the Company (or similar transaction) in which no &quot;person&quot; (as

   Company's then outstanding securities; or (iv) the stockholders of the
   Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an
