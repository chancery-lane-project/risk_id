<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT</B></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Stock Option Agreement (the <B>"Agreement"</B>) is made as of June 15, 2000, by and between Old Kent Financial Corporation, a Michigan corporation (<B>"Grantee"</B>), and Home
Bancorp, an Indiana corporation (<B>"Issuer"</B>).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a condition to, and contemporaneous with, the execution of this Agreement, the parties are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 15, 2000 (the<B> "Plan of
Merger"</B>). In consideration therefor, and as an inducement to Grantee to pursue the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Merger, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as defined below). The board of directors of Issuer has approved the grant of
the Option and the Plan of Merger. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to those terms in the Plan of Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In consideration of the foregoing, and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan of Merger, the parties agree:</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Grant of Option</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the <B>"Option"</B>) to purchase, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
up to 197,092 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuer Common Stock, without par value (<B>"Common Stock"</B>), at a price per share equal to $14.75; <I>provided</I> that in the event Issuer issues or agrees to issue any shares of Common Stock prior to an Exercise Termination Event (or such later date as provided in Section 10) at a price
per share less than $14.75 (as adjusted pursuant to Section 5(b)) (other than Permitted Issuances under the Plan of Merger), such price shall be equal to such lesser price (as adjusted, if applicable, the <B>"Option Price"</B>) for each share of Common Stock then remaining subject to the Option;<I> further provided</I>, that in no event shall the number of shares for which this Option is exercisable, together with the number of shares owned by Grantee
other than shares held by Grantee in a fiduciary capacity for a customer as to which it has no beneficial interest (<B>"Fiduciary Shares"</B>), exceed 9.999% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, in the event that any additional
shares of Common Stock are issued or otherwise become outstanding (other than pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to an event described in Section 5(a) of this Agreement) or existing shares are redeemed, retired or otherwise become no longer
outstanding after the date of this Agreement so that, after any such issuance, redemption or retirement, together with the number of shares previously issued pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise owned by Grantee other than Fiduciary Shares, the number
of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option equals 9.999% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be considered to authorize Issuer to issue shares in breach of any provision of the Plan of Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Exercise of Option.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The holder or holders of the Option (the <B>"Holder"</B>) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, if and when at any time both an Initial
Triggering Event (as defined below) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as defined below) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as defined below), <I>provided</I> that the Holder shall have sent notice of such exercise (as required by Section 2(f)) within six months following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later date as provided in Section 10). </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each of the following shall be an <B>"Exercise Termination Event"</B>: (i) consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time of the Merger;
(ii)&nbsp;termination of the Plan of Merger in accordance with the provisions thereof if such termination occurs before the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event; and (iii) the passage of 18 months (or such longer period as is provided in Section 10)
after termination of the Plan of Merger if such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) the Option may not be exercised at any time when Grantee shall be in
material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in the Plan of Merger such that Issuer shall then be entitled to terminate the Plan of Merger as a result of such material breach; and (ii) this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon
the proper termination of the Plan of Merger (x) by Issuer as a result of the material breach by Grantee of its covenants or agreements contained in the Plan of Merger, or (y) by Issuer or Grantee if the approval by any federal or state governmental
authority or regulatory or administrative agency or commission (each a <B>"Governmental Entity"</B>) necessary to consummate the Merger shall have been denied by final nonappealable action of such agency or authority.</P>

into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below) with any person (for purposes of this Agreement, the term "person" has the meaning given that term in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

shareholders to approve the issuance of shares to be offered in such an exchange or tender offer);</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (vii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Issuer shall have willfully breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Plan of Merger in anticipation of engaging in an Acquisition

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (d)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The term <B>"Subsequent Triggering Event"</B> shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date of this Agreement

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (f)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Holder is entitled and wishes to exercise the Option (or any portion thereof), it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of such
notice is referred to as the <B>"Notice Date"</B>) specifying: (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise; and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 45 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such
purchase (the <B>"Closing Date"</B>); <I>provided,</I> that if prior notification to or approval of any Governmental Entity is required in connection with such purchase, Holder shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval, shall notify Issuer of
such filing, and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals
have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be considered to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (g)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the closing referred to in Section 2(f), Holder shall (i) pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased
pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer and (ii) present and surrender this Agreement to Issuer at its principal executive offices. Failure or refusal of Issuer to
designate such a bank account or accept surrender of this Agreement shall not preclude Holder from exercising the Option.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (h)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in Section 2(g), Issuer shall deliver to Holder a
certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the balance of the shares subject to this Option.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing under this Agreement may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read
substantially as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to certain provisions of an agreement, dated as of June 15, 2000, between the registered holder hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor."</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the <B>"Securities Act"</B>), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference
if Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act;
(ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in<BR>

<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>
<BR>

compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference in the opinion of counsel to Holder; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding
clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (j)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the giving by Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under Section 2(f) and the tender of the
applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, Holder shall be considered, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that
the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, state and local taxes and other
charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Covenants of Issuer.</I> Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Common
Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or
through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed under this
Agreement by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all applicable premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements and (y) if, under the applicable federal or state
regulatory requirements or any state or federal banking law, prior approval of or notice to any Governmental Entity is necessary before the Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with Holder in preparing such applications or notices and providing such
information to each such Governmental Entity as it may require) to permit Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided in this
Agreement to protect the rights of Holder against dilution.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Exchange of Option. </I>This Agreement (and the Option granted by this Agreement) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of Holder, upon presentation and surrender of
this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling Holder to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth in this Agreement, in the aggregate
the same number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used in this Agreement include any stock option agreements and related options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted by this Agreement) may
be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender
and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>
<BR>

such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Adjustments. </I>In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, mergers,
recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be appropriately adjusted and proper provision shall be made so that, if any additional
shares of Common Stock are to be issued or otherwise become outstanding as a result of any such change (other than pursuant to an exercise of the Option), the number of shares of Common Stock that remain subject to the Option shall be increased so that,
after such issuance and together with shares of Common Stock previously issued pursuant to the exercise of the Option (as adjusted on account of any of the foregoing changes in the Common Stock), such number equals 9.999% of the number of shares of Common
Stock then issued and outstanding.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option is adjusted as provided in this Section 5, the Option Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Option Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to the Option after the adjustment.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Registration Rights. </I>Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee
delivered within 12 months (or such later period as provided in Section 10) of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or owner of any of the shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act covering any shares issued and/or issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective and remain current to permit the sale or other disposition of any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option (<B>"Option Shares"</B>) in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement promptly to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not
in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. Issuer
shall bear the costs of both of such registrations (including, without limitation, Issuer's attorneys' fees, printing costs and filing fees, except for underwriting discounts or commissions, brokers' fees and the fees and disbursements of Grantee's
counsel related thereto). Notwithstanding the above, if, at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>
<BR>

the time of any request by Grantee for registration of Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in the process of registration with respect to an underwritten public offering by Issuer of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the
managing underwriter or managing underwriters (or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters) of such offering, the offer and sale of the Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the
number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated by this Section 6 may be reduced; <I>provided,</I> that, after any such required reduction, the number of Option Shares included in such offering for the account of Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; <I>
provided further</I>, that if such reduction occurs, then Issuer shall file a registration statement (which shall not count as one of Holder's two demand registrations) for the balance of the Option Shares subject to the registration demand as promptly as practical as to
which no reduction pursuant to this Section 6 shall be permitted or occur and, if such required reduction occurs in connection with the Holder's first demand registration, the 12 month period referred to in the first sentence of this Section shall be
increased to 24 months for the Holder's second demand registration. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed to register Option Shares. If requested by any such
Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other
agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements for an issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights
under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the number of
registrations that Issuer is obligated to effect be increased by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Holder as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Repurchase of Option.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At any time after the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (defined below): (i) at the request of Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination
Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer (or any successor to Issuer) shall repurchase the Option from Holder at a price (the <B>"Option Repurchase Price"</B>) equal to the amount by which (x) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (y) the Option Price, multiplied by the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised; and (ii) at the request of the owner
of Option Shares from time to time (the <B>"Owner"</B>), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer (or any successor to Issuer) shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from Owner as Owner shall designate at a price (the <B>
"Option Share Repurchase Price"</B>) equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term <B>"Market/Offer Price"</B> shall mean the highest of: (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender or exchange offer therefor has been
made after the date hereof; (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement entered into with Issuer after the date hereof; (iii) the highest closing sale price for shares of Common Stock reported<BR>

<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>

to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates
representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered in immediately available funds to Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price

Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to

<DIR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the acquisition by any person (other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary) of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the consummation of any Acquisition Transaction described in clause (i) of Section 2(c), except that the percentage referred to for purposes of

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If, prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement to (i) consolidate or merge with any person, other than Grantee

share exchange, (ii) permit any person, other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, to merge into Issuer or be acquired by Issuer in a plan of share exchange and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such
merger or plan of share exchange, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after
such merger or plan of share exchange represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged or acquiring company, or (iii) sell or otherwise transfer all or a substantial part of its or any Issuer Subsidiary's assets or
deposits to any person, other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the <B>"Substitute Option"</B>), at the election of Holder, to acquire capital stock of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as defined below) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.</P>

number of shares owned by Grantee other than Fiduciary Shares, is more than 9.999% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than

Option Holder at a price (the <B>"Substitute Option Repurchase Price"</B>) equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as defined below) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which
the Substitute Option may then be exercised. In addition, at the request of the owner (the <B>"Substitute Share Owner"</B>) of shares of Substitute Common Stock, the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Common Stock at a price (the <B>"Substitute Share Repurchase Price"</B>) equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by
the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock so designated. The term <B>"Highest Closing Price" </B>shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute

legal approvals as promptly as practicable to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Common Stock either in whole or to the extent

Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (x) to the Substitute Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of the Substitute Option Holder to
purchase that number of shares of Substitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price previously delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and the denominator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase
Price, and/or (y) to the Substitute Share Owner, a certificate for the Substitute Common Stock it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. If an Exercise Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the date of the notice by the Substitute Option Issuer
described in the first sentence of Section 9(c), or shall be scheduled to occur at any time before the expiration of a period ending on the thirtieth day after such date, the Substitute Option Holder shall nevertheless have the right to exercise the
Substitute Option until the expiration of such 30-day period</P>

time, if ever, as it considers appropriate to do so.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Minimum Repurchase Proceeds.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grantee may, at any time following a Repurchase Event that occurs prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (or such later period
as provided in Section 10), relinquish the Option (together with any Option Shares issued to and then owned by Grantee) to Issuer in exchange for a cash fee equal to the Surrender Price; <I>provided, </I>that Grantee may not exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 14 if Issuer has repurchased the Option (or any portion thereof) or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grantee may exercise its right to relinquish the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 14 by surrendering to Issuer, at its
principal office, a copy of this Agreement together with certificates for Option Shares, if any, accompanied by a written notice stating (i) that Grantee elects to relinquish the Option and Option Shares, if any, in accordance with the provisions of this

use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to make such payments, (B) within five days of the submission or receipt of any documents
relating to any such regulatory and legal approvals, provide Grantee with copies of the same, and (C) keep Grantee advised of both the status of any such request for regulatory and legal approvals, as well as any discussions with any relevant regulatory
or other third party reasonably related to the same; and (ii) Grantee may revoke such notice of surrender by delivery of a notice of revocation to Issuer and, upon delivery of such notice of revocation, the date of any Exercise Termination Event shall be
extended to a date six months from the date on which the Exercise Termination Event would have occurred if not for the provisions of this Section 14(c) (during which period Grantee may exercise any of its rights under this Agreement, including any and all
rights pursuant to this Section 14). </P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Remedies. </I>The parties acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party and that the obligations of the parties shall be
enforceable by either party through injunctive or other equitable relief. In connection therewith, the parties waive the posting of any bond or similar requirement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Severability. </I>If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any
reason such court or regulatory agency determines that Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) (as adjusted pursuant to Sections
1(b) or 5), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow Holder to acquire or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or modification of this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Notices. </I>All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered to have been duly given if

overnight delivery service (all fees prepaid) to the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the Plan of Merger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Governing Law. </I>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws.</P>
