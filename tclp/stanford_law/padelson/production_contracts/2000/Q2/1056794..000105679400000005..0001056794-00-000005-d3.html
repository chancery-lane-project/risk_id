defined in Section 3.1 below), then at any time during the period between August 15 and August 25th, 2000, Tenant may provide
written notice to Landlord electing to terminate this Lease; provided, however, Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease,
as provided above, if Tenant has taken occupancy of all or any part of the Building. If, within five (5) days following a
termination notice by Tenant, Phase 1 of the Tenant Improvements are not substantially completed, then this Lease shall terminate
upon the expiration of such five (5) day period and, thereafter, neither Landlord nor Tenant shall have any further rights or

Letter of Credit with Landlord within fifteen (15) days following Tenant's execution of this Lease. Tenant's failure to deliver the
security deposit or any component thereof, as and when required in this Section 5 shall be a material default by Tenant under this

construction of the Tenant Improvements until the default is cured. In addition, any cessation of work shall be automatically

below.    As soon as practicable after the expiration or termination of this Lease, Landlord shall return the security deposit to
Tenant, less such amounts as are reasonably necessary to remedy Tenant's defaults in payment of Rent, to repair damages to the
Premises caused by Tenant or to clean the Premises upon such termination, reasonable and normal wear and tear excepted.  In the
event of the sale of the Building, the security deposit will be transferred to the purchaser and Landlord will be relieved of any
liability with reference to such security deposit upon such transfer.  Landlord shall not be required to keep the security deposit
separate from its other funds, and Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on such deposit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest
shall accrue on the unused balance of the Cash Deposit at an annual rate of two percent (2%) from the date the Cash Deposit is
placed with Landlord through the date that the Cash Deposit, or any remaining portion thereof, is returned to Tenant following the
expiration or termination of this Lease. Accrued interest on the unused portion of the Cash Deposit shall only be payable to Tenant
upon the expiration or termination of this Lease; provided, however, no interest shall be payable to Tenant if this Lease has been

<DIR>

<P>6.1&#9;<B>Payment by Tenant</B> .  Pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant's Percentage Share of
Operating Expenses and Taxes.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;a.<B>&#9;Operating Expenses</B> .  Landlord shall determine or estimate the amount of Tenant's Percentage Share of
Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which the Occupancy Date occurs.  Beginning on the Commencement Date, one-twelfth (1/12)
of the amount estimated by Landlord to be Tenant's Percentage Share of Operating Expenses shall be due and payable by Tenant to
Landlord, as Additional Rent, on the first day of each calendar month remaining in the calendar year.  Thereafter, Landlord may
estimate such increases to Tenant's Percentage Share of Operating Expenses as of the beginning of each calendar year and may require
Tenant to pay one-twelfth (1/12) of such estimated amount as Additional Rent hereunder as of the first day of each calendar
month.</P>

<P>In the event that during the course of any calendar year Operating Expenses have increased by more than five percent (5%) over
the amount of Operating Expenses estimated by Landlord at the commencement of that calendar year, Landlord may recalculate the
amount of the monthly estimated payments to be paid by Tenant in order to take into account any such increases and, following notice
from Landlord of any such increase, Tenant shall pay the full amount of the recalculated payments on a monthly basis for the
remainder of the subject calendar year.  In making the aforesaid recalculation, Landlord may include amounts necessary to reimburse
Landlord for any increased Operating Expenses applicable to that portion of the subject calendar year, which was prior to the date
of Landlord's notice.</P>

<P>Not later than ninety (90) days following any calendar year (including the year following the year in which this Lease
terminates), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a true and correct accounting of the actual Operating Expenses incurred by Landlord
in the preceding calendar year, and within thirty (30) days of Landlord's delivery of such accounting, Tenant shall pay to Landlord
the amount of any underpayment by Tenant of Tenant's Percentage Share of Operating Expenses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure
by Landlord to give such accounting shall not constitute a waiver by Landlord of its right to collect Tenant's Percentage Share of
Operating Expenses or any underpayment by Tenant thereof.  Landlord shall credit the amount of any overpayment by Tenant toward the
next estimated installment(s) of Tenant's Percentage Share of Operating Expenses or, where the term of the Lease has expired or been
terminated (other than due to a default by Tenant), shall refund the amount of overpayment to Tenant within thirty (30) days without
obligation upon Tenant to demand such refund from Landlord.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;b.&#9;<B>Taxes</B> .  Tenant shall pay to Tenant's Percentage Share of Taxes within ten (10) days following the written
demand by Landlord therefor, which demand shall be accompanied by a copy of the tax bill reflecting the Taxes for which Landlord is
seeking payment and shall be made by Landlord no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Taxes.  If any Taxes
cover any period of time either prior to the Occupancy Date or after the expiration of the Lease Term, Tenant's Percentage Share of
Taxes shall be prorated to cover only the period of time following the Commencement Date or prior to the expiration of the Lease
Term, as applicable.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Within twelve (12) months following the end of any calendar year, Tenant shall have the right, at it sole cost and expense, to
review Landlord's books and records with respect to the Operating Expenses and Taxes for such calendar year. If upon such review it
is determined that there were any errors in the calculation of Operating Expenses or Taxes, then, within thirty (30) days after such
determination, Landlord shall credit any overpayment by Tenant to Base Rent thereafter becoming due or Tenant shall pay to Landlord
any underpayment, as the case may be.  In the event that a review by Tenant determines that Tenant has overpaid by more than three
percent (3%), then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Tenant in connection with such
review. </P>

<P>&#9;6.2&#9;<B>Definitions</B> .  "<B>Tenant's Percentage Share</B>" shall be (a) one hundred percent (100%) which respect to all
Operating Expenses and Taxes which are directly attributable to Building, including, without limitation, all Common Area Expenses
(as defined in the Declaration) which are allocable to the Building's Exclusive Common Area, and (b) forty-nine and nine tenths
percent (49.9%) as to Common Area Expenses which are attributable to the Non-Exclusive Common Areas (as defined in the Declaration).
</P>

<P>"<B>Operating Expenses</B>" are defined as all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by Landlord in connection with the
ownership, maintenance, repair, management, and operation of the Premises, the Building, and the Common Areas, which reasonable
costs and expenses shall include, without limit, the following:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;i.&#9;Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses in carrying out repairs and maintenance pursuant to Section&nbsp;11.2(b)
and (c) below, the Building's percentage share of all Common Area Expenses and other expenses benefiting the Project in general and
all of the Exclusive Common Area Expenses allocable to the Building;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;ii.&#9;Landlord's cost of fire, extended coverage (including rental loss insurance) and other insurance for the Building
and the Land;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;iii. &#9;Landlord's reasonable cost of the fire sprinkler monitoring system; </P>

<P>&#9;&#9;iv.&#9;an annual management fee equal to three percent (3%) of the gross revenues from the Building; and,</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;v.&#9;the amortized portion of any capital expenditure incurred by Landlord with respect to the Building, to the extent
such capital expenditures are intended to reduce or replace other items of Operating Expenses. </P>

<P>"Amortized portion" of any capital expenditure to be paid by Tenant shall mean Tenant's Percentage Share of the following: the
amount of the expenditure amortized (on a monthly basis) over the useful life of the item to which the expenditure is applicable.
Tenant's Percentage Share of such amortized amount shall be payable in each month after such expenditure is incurred until the
earlier of (i) the expiration of the Lease Term, or (ii) the end of the useful life of the item to which the expenditure is
applicable </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"<B>Taxes</B>" are defined as all real property taxes applicable to the Land, the Building, and the Premises.  The term "real
property taxes" shall include any form of assessment (general, special, supplemental, ordinary or extraordinary), commercial rental
tax, improvement bond or bonds, license fee, license tax, rental tax, levy, penalty imposed by any authority having the direct or
indirect power of tax, including any city, county, state or federal government, or any school, agricultural, lighting, drainage or
other improvement district thereof, as against any legal or equitable interest of Landlord in the Land, the Building, and/or the
Premises, as against Landlord's right to rent or to other income therefrom, or as against Landlord's business of leasing the
Premises or the occupancy of Tenant, or any other tax, fee, or excise, however described, including any value added tax, or any tax
imposed in substitution, partially or totally, of any tax previously included within the definition of real property taxes, or any
additional tax, the nature of which was previously included within the definition of real property tax.  The term "real property
taxes" shall not include any income or franchise taxes imposed on Landlord. If, for any reason, the Taxes for the Land, Building,
and Premises are not separately assessed from the Project as a whole, then Taxes shall be allocated to the Land, Building, and
Premises based upon the percentage in which Common Area Expenses are allocated to the Building pursuant to the Declaration. </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>7.&#9;<B>Utilities</B>.  Tenant shall be solely responsible for paying the cost of all water, gas, heat, electricity, telephone,
garbage and other utilities directly used on the Premises.  Tenant shall pay directly to the utility provider the cost of all such
utilities. Tenant, as part of Tenant's Percentage Share of Operating Expenses, will pay for a portion of the utilities servicing the
Non-Exclusive Common Area and for all of the utilities servicing the Building's Exclusive Common Area. </P>

<P>8.&#9;<B>Late Charges</B>.  Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Base Rent, Tenant's Percentage Share
of Operating Expenses and Taxes or other sums due hereunder will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the
exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult and impracticable to fix.  Such costs include, without limitation, processing
and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any encumbrances or notes secured by any
encumbrance covering the Premises.  Therefore, if any installment of Base Rent or other sum due from Tenant is not received by
Landlord when due, then, within ten (10) days following the date said Base Rent or other sum is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord,
without additional invoice or demand, an additional sum equal to six percent (6%) of such overdue amount as a late charge; provided,
however, if payments of Base Rent have been made to Landlord in a timely manner pursuant to automatic wire transfer then the late
charge herein shall be an additional sum equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue amount. The parties agree that this late charge
represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant.  The accrual
and/or acceptance of any late charge shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant's default with respect to the overdue amount, nor
prevent Landlord from exercising any of Landlord's other rights and remedies.</P>

<P>9.&#9;<B>Use of Premises; Compliance with Laws</B>.</P>

bring anything or permit anything to be kept or brought therein which will in any way increase the existing rate of or affect any

subrogation, or is obtainable only by the payment of an additional premium charge above that charged by insurance companies issuing
policies without waivers of subrogation, the party undertaking to obtain the insurance shall notify the other party of this fact.
The other party shall have a period of thirty&nbsp;(30) days after receiving such notice either to replace the insurance with a
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the other party and that will carry the insurance with a waiver of subrogation, or to
agree to pay the additional premium if such policy is obtainable at additional cost.  If the insurance cannot be obtained or the
party in whose favor a waiver of subrogation is desired refuses to pay the additional premium charge, the other party is relieved of
the obligation to obtain a waiver of subrogation rights with respect to the particular insurance involved.</P>

and (b) any Release of any Hazardous Materials in or about the Premises, the Building and/or the Land, to the extent the Release is
caused or permitted by Tenant, or any of its agents, employees, contractors, subcontractors and/or invitees.  Tenant's indemnity
obligations under this Section&nbsp;13 shall survive termination of this Lease.</P>

<P>Landlord, and Landlord's partners, employees, agents, and contractors, shall not be liable to Tenant for any damage to Tenant or
Tenant's property, nor for any injury to or loss of Tenant's business nor for any damage or injury to any person from any cause;
provided, however, Landlord shall be liable for, and shall indemnify, defend and hold Tenant harmless from and against any claims
arising in connection with, property damage and bodily injury resulting from the willful misconduct or negligent acts or omissions
of Landlord, or any of its partners, employees, agents, or contractors, but only to the extent any such property damage and bodily
injury is not covered by either the insurance required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease or by any other insurance
actually maintained by Tenant.</P>

<P>14.&#9;<B>Assignment and Subletting</B>.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;14.1&#9;<B>In General</B>.  Tenant shall not, either voluntarily or by operation of law, </P>
<P>assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or encumber this Lease or any interest therein, and shall not sublet the Premises
or any part thereof, or any right or privilege appurtenant thereto, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Landlord shall be reasonable in withholding its consent to any proposed assignment if the net
worth of the proposed assignee is not equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant as of the date of execution of this Lease or
the date of the proposed assignment, whichever is higher. Tenant shall give Landlord at least fifteen (15) days written notice of
its desire to assign or sublet all or some of the Premises.  Any such assignment, sublease or the like which is approved by Landlord
must be pursuant to a written agreement in a form acceptable to Landlord.  Each permitted assignee, transferee, or sublessee shall
assume and be deemed to have assumed this Lease (or the appropriate part hereof) and shall be and remain jointly and severally
liable with Tenant for the payment of Rents and for the due performance of and compliance with all the terms, covenants, conditions
and agreements to be performed or complied with by Tenant herein (including, but not limited to, the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;14). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord consents to a full assignment of this Lease by the original Tenant
hereunder during the initial ten (10) year term hereof, then the original Tenant hereunder shall be released from any obligations
under this Lease if the transferee elects to exercise the Option pursuant to Section 3.2 above; provided, however, if, in evaluating
the proposed assignment, Landlord determines that the proposed transferee's projected financial condition during the Extended Term
is not satisfactory, then Tenant shall elect to either (a) assign to the proposed transferee only Tenant's rights through the
remaining initial ten (10) year Lease Term (in which event the transferee shall have no right to exercise the Option), or (b) remain
liable for any and all obligations arising under this Lease during the Extended Term to the extent the transferee exercises the
Option. Upon any release of the original Tenant, as provided above, such original Tenant shall have no right to retain any portion
of Excess Rents (as provided in Section 14.4 below) or any other rents or other charges which are paid or payable by any assignee or
other party during the Extended Term. </P>

<P>&#9;14.2&#9;<B>Transfers of Interests in Tenant</B> .  Any merger or reorganization of the entity which comprises Tenant, any
sale, or transfer of substantially all of the assets of Tenant, or any sale or other transfer of a majority of the interests in
Tenant shall not be deemed an assignment of this Lease requiring the prior written consent of Landlord pursuant to Section&nbsp;14.1
1 above.</P>

<P>&#9;14.3&#9;<B>Right to Terminate</B>.  If Tenant notifies Landlord of its desire to assign this Lease or any interest herein, to
sublet all or any part of the Premises for more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the remainder of the Lease Term, or to sublet
more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Premises for any period, Landlord may elect to treat Tenant's notice as an offer to
terminate this Lease or Tenant's interest in the portion of the Premises specified and, thereupon, Landlord shall have the right to
terminate the Lease (a) entirely, in the event of a proposed assignment or a sublease of the entire Premises for the remainder of
the Lease Term, (b) as to the portion of the Premises which is the subject of a proposed sublease for more than seventy-five percent
(75%) of the remainder of the Lease Term, or (c) as to the portion of the Premises which is the subject of a proposed sublease of
more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Premises for any period, as specified in Tenant's notice.  For purposes of this
Section&nbsp;14.3, (i) the term of a proposed sublease shall include all options to extend or renew, and (ii) a proposed sublease
shall be deemed to be for the remainder of the Lease Term if the term of the proposed sublease will expire within one (1) year of
the end of the Lease Term.  If Tenant's notice specifies all of the Premises and Landlord elects to terminate, this Lease shall
terminate on the date stated in the notice given by Tenant pursuant to Section&nbsp;14.1 above, subject to any obligations which
have accrued and are unfulfilled as of such date.  If Tenant's notice specifies less than all of the Premises and Landlord elects to
terminate, this Lease shall terminate on the date stated with respect to that portion of the Premises, and Base Rent and Tenant's
Percentage Share shall be adjusted, based upon the area retained by Tenant after the termination, compared to the total area of the
entire Premises excluding any areas of the Premises designated in the proposed sublease for ingress and egress and common areas.
The Lease as so amended shall continue thereafter in full force and effect.  Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment to this
Lease specifying the new Premises, the adjusted Base Rent and Tenant's adjusted Percentage Share; provided, however, that failure by
either party to execute such an amendment shall not affect the validity of this Lease.</P>

<P>&#9;14.4&#9;<B>Excess Rents</B>.  Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 14.1 above, any Excess Rents (defined below)
payable pursuant to any assignment or subletting shall be paid to Landlord and Tenant on a fifty-fifty (50-50) basis.  Landlord
shall have the right to impose terms and conditions on its consent to any assignment or subletting to assure the accounting and
payment of Landlord's share of Excess Rents.  "Excess Rents" shall mean any and all rents, payments, charges and other
considerations to be received by Tenant upon an assignment or subletting of all or any portion of the Premises which are in excess
of the Rents payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease after the recovery by Tenant of reasonable and customary amounts for
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, and tenant improvement costs, to the extent such items have been actually incurred by Tenant
in connection with the subject assignment or sublease.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>15.&#9;<B>Ad Valorem Taxes</B>.  Tenant shall pay before delinquent all taxes assessed against the personal property of Tenant
and all taxes attributable to any leasehold improvements installed by Tenant.</P>

<P>16.&#9;<B>Lender Requirements</B>.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;16.1&#9;<B>Subordination</B>.  This Lease is subordinate to any and all mortgages and/or deeds of trust ("Encumbrances") now
of record against the Land and/or the Building.  Tenant shall, upon the request of Landlord, execute any instrument reasonably
necessary or desirable to (a) acknowledge the subordination of this Lease to any existing mortgages or deeds of trust, or (b)
subordinate this Lease and all of Tenant's rights hereunder to any and all Encumbrances hereafter recorded against the Land and/or
the Building; provided, however, Tenant may require as a condition to any subordination in (b) above that the holder of any future
Encumbrance agree to not disturb Tenant's possession of the Premises under the terms of this Lease in the event such holder acquires
the Premises pursuant to foreclosure or otherwise. In addition to requiring nondisturbance protection as provided in the preceding
sentence, as to any future Encumbrance arranged by the original Landlord under this Lease or by any entity affiliated with such
original Landlord, then Tenant may require that (1) Landlord has made a collateral assignment to the holder of any future
Encumbrance of the Letter of Credit provided that Landlord may retain all rights to such Letter of Credit unless and until there has
been a default on the part of Landlord in connection with such Future Encumbrance and (2) the holder of any future Encumbrance which
takes an assignment of the Letter of Credit agrees in writing that such assignment, for so long as the same is in effect, shall be
regarded as having possession of that portion of the Security Deposit which is represented by the Letter of Credit.</P>

<P>&#9;16.2&#9;<B>Attornment</B>.  In the event any proceedings are brought for foreclosure or in the event of the exercise of the
power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant shall, at the option of such
purchaser, attorn to the purchaser upon any such foreclosure or sale and shall recognize such purchaser as the Landlord under this
Lease, provided such purchaser agrees in writing to assume all obligations of Landlord under this Lease accruing following such sale
or purchase and provides a copy of such agreement to Tenant.</P>

<P>&#9;16.3&#9;<B>Approval by Lender</B>.  Tenant acknowledges that any future holder of an Encumbrance may retain the right to
approve the terms and provisions of this Lease.  Tenant agrees that, in the event such holder shall require any modification of this
Lease in order to protect its security interest in the Premises; provided, however, no modification of this Lease shall materially
increase Tenant's obligations under this Lease or impose requirements upon Tenant which are more burdensome.</P>
<P> </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>17.&#9;<B>Right of Entry</B>.  Tenant grants Landlord or its agents the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times
during normal business hours for purposes of inspection, exhibition, repair or alteration; provided, however, Landlord shall give
Tenant at least one (1) business day prior notice (except in the event of emergency) of Landlord's intent to enter the Premises.
Landlord shall have the right to use any and all means Landlord deems necessary to enter the Premises in an emergency.  Landlord
shall also have the right (a) to place "for rent" signs of a reasonable size on the outside of the Premises at a reasonable location
during the last six (6) months of the Lease Term and (b) to place &quot;for sale&quot; signs of a reasonable size on the outside of
the Premises at a reasonable location at any time.  Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages or for any injury or inconvenience to
or interference with Tenant's business, or any other loss occasioned thereby; provided, however, Landlord shall be liable for
property damage and bodily injury resulting from the negligent acts or omissions of Landlord or Landlord's authorized
representatives (except where Landlord is released from liability for negligence in Section&nbsp;12.3 above).</P>

<P>18.&#9;<B>Estoppel Certificate</B>.  Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord, upon not less than five (5)) days prior
written notice, a statement in writing certifying (a) that this Lease is unmodified and is in full force and effect (or, if
modified, stating the nature of such modification), (b) the date to which Rent and other charges are paid in advance, if any, (c)
that there are not, to such party's knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of the other party or specifying such defaults as
they are claimed, and (d) such other information (including, without limitation, current financial information of Tenant) as a
prospective purchaser, lender or encumbrancer of the Premises may reasonably require.  Any such statement may be conclusively relied
upon by any prospective purchaser, encumbrancer, assignee or subletter of the Premises, as applicable.  A failure by Tenant to
provide the statement and information required within the time and manner provided herein shall be a material default on the part of
Tenant. Landlord shall execute and deliver to Tenant, upon not less than five (5)) days prior written notice, a statement in writing
certifying (a) that this Lease is unmodified and is in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such
modification), (b) the date to which Rent and other charges are paid in advance, if any, and (c) that there are not, to such party's
knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of the other party or specifying such defaults as they are claimed. </P>

<P>19.&#9;<B>Tenant's Default</B>.  The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute a default and breach
of this Lease by Tenant:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;a.&#9;The failure by Tenant to make any payment of Rent or any other payment required hereunder within five (5) days from the
date the same is due and payable;</P>

<P>&#9;b.&#9;Tenant abandons the Premises for a continuous period of at least thirty (30) days;</P>

<P>&#9;c.&#9;The failure of Tenant to observe, perform or comply with any of the conditions or provisions of this Lease for a
period, unless a longer period is otherwise provided herein, of thirty (30) days after written notice, or if such default cannot be
cured within that time, then such additional time as may be reasonably necessary if within such thirty (30) days Tenant has
commenced and is diligently pursuing such activities as are necessary to cure the default; and</P>

<P>&#9;d.&#9;Tenant becomes the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or
involuntary, and, in the case of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, Tenant fails to cause the same to be dismissed within sixty
(60) days following that date of the filing of such bankruptcy.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Any notice from Landlord to Tenant described in this Section&nbsp;19 shall, in the sole discretion of Landlord, constitute a
three (3) day notice pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section&nbsp;1161 or any successor statute.  With respect to any
"default" by Tenant referenced in this Lease, the term "default" as used in such context shall mean any of the events described in
subsections&nbsp;(a), (b) and/or (c) of this Section&nbsp;19.</P>

<P>20.&#9;<B>Remedies for Tenant's Default</B>.  Upon any default by Tenant, Landlord shall have the following remedies, in addition
to all other rights and remedies provided by law, to which Landlord may resort cumulatively, or in the alternative:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;20.1&#9;<B>Termination</B>.  Upon any default by Tenant, Landlord shall have the right (but not the obligation) to terminate
this Lease and Tenant's right to possession of the Premises.  If Landlord has given Tenant any written notice pursuant to
Section&nbsp;19 above, then Landlord shall not be required to give Tenant any additional notice terminating this Lease.  Upon
termination of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right to recover from Tenant:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;a.&#9;The worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rents which had been earned at the time of termination;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;b.&#9;The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the </P>
<P>Rents, which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant
proves, could have been reasonably avoided;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;c.&#9;The worth at the time of award (computed by discounting at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco at the time of award plus one percent) of the amount by which the Rents for the balance of the Lease Term after the time
of award exceed the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;d.&#9;Any other amounts necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by the default by Tenant or
which in the ordinary course of events would likely result, including without limitation the following:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;Expenses in retaking possession of the Premises;</P>

<P>(ii)&#9;Expenses for cleaning, repairing or restoring the Premises;</P>

<P>(iii)&#9;Expenses for removing, transporting, and storing any of Tenant's property left at the Premises (although Landlord shall
have no obligation to remove, transport, or store any such property);</P></DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The "worth at the time of award" of the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section&nbsp;20.1 is computed by
allowing interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of: ten percent (10%); or five percent (5%) plus the rate established by
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, as of the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the month immediately preceding the default by
Tenant, on advances to member banks under Sections&nbsp;13 and 13(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, as now in effect or hereafter from
time to time amended, not to exceed the maximum rate allowable by law.</P>

<P>&#9;20.2&#9;<B>Continuance of Lease</B> .  Upon a default by Tenant and unless and until Landlord elects to terminate this Lease
pursuant to Section&nbsp;20.1 above, this Lease shall continue in effect after the default by Tenant, and Landlord may enforce all
rights and remedies under this Lease, including, without limitation, the right to recover payment of Rents as they become due.
Neither efforts by Landlord to mitigate damages caused by a default by Tenant nor the acceptance of any Rents shall constitute a
waiver by Landlord of any of Landlord's rights or remedies, including the rights and remedies specified in this Section&nbsp;20. It
is intended that the remedy set forth in this Section 20.2 is to provide Landlord the rights set forth in California Civil Code
Section 1951.4. The use restrictions set forth in Section 9 above shall apply to Landlord's rights under this Section 20.2 except to
the extent Tenant proves under all circumstances that the enforcement of such restrictions would be unreasonable.</P>

<P>&#9;20.3&#9;<B>Reletting Premises</B> .   Upon a default by Tenant, Landlord may, at Landlord's election, re-enter the Premises
and, without terminating this Lease, and at any time and from time to time, relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof for the
account and in the name of Tenant or otherwise.  Landlord may, at Landlord's election, eject Tenant or any of Tenant's subtenants,
assignees or other person claiming any right in or through this Lease.  Tenant shall nevertheless pay to Landlord on the due dates
specified in this Lease all sums required to be paid by Tenant under this Lease, plus Landlord's expenses, less the proceeds of any
sublease or reletting.  Notwithstanding any prior reletting without termination, Landlord may later elect to terminate this Lease
because of default by Tenant.</P>

<P>&#9;20.4&#9;<B>Right to Cure Tenant's Default</B> .  In the event Tenant fails to cure a default described under
Section&nbsp;19(b) within a period of thirty (30) days after written notice (unless a longer period of time is otherwise provided
herein), Landlord may, in addition to all other rights and remedies under this Lease, to which Landlord may resort cumulatively or
in the alternative, cure such default and demand reimbursement by Tenant of the cost actually incurred by Landlord in curing such
default by Tenant, with interest thereon from the date such cost is incurred by Landlord until payment.  All amounts due and payable
to Landlord under this Section&nbsp;20.4 shall constitute Rent under this Lease.  The cure by Landlord of any default shall in no
way be deemed a waiver or release of Tenant from any obligation under this Lease.</P>

<P>A.&#9;In the event Tenant shall become a Debtor under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code ("Code") or a petition for reorganization
or adjustment of debts is filed concerning Tenant under Chapters 11 or 13 of the Code, or a proceeding is filed under Chapter 7 and
is transferred to Chapters 11 or 13, the Trustee or Tenant, as Debtor-In-Possession, may not elect to assume this Lease unless, at
the time of such assumption, the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession has:</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(1) &#9;Within ten (10) days from the date of such assumption the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession will cure
all monetary defaults under this Lease; and</P>

defaults under this Lease.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;For purposes of this Section 21.1, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that, in the context of a bankruptcy
proceeding of Tenant, at a minimum "Adequate Assurance" shall mean:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;The Trustee or the Debtor-In-Possession has and will continue to have sufficient resources to fulfill the
obligations of Tenant under this Lease as the same become due; and</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered an Order segregating sufficient cash payable to Landlord and/or
the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession shall have granted a valid and perfected first lien and security interest and/or mortgage in
property of Tenant, Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession, acceptable as to value and kind to Landlord, to secure to Landlord the
obligation of the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession to cure the monetary and/or non-monetary defaults under this Lease within the time
periods set forth above.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>B.&#9;If the Trustee or Debtor-In-Possession has assumed the Lease pursuant to the provisions of this Section 21.1 for the
purpose of assigning Tenant's interest hereunder to any other person or entity, such interest may be assigned only after the
Trustee, Debtor-In-Possession or the proposed assignee have complied with all of the terms, covenants and conditions of Section 14.1
herein, Landlord and Tenant acknowledging that such terms, covenants and conditions are commercially reasonable in the consent of a
bankruptcy proceeding of Tenant.    The terms of Section 14.1 applicable to any such assignment shall include, without limitation,
those with respect to Additional Rent and the use of the Premises only as permitted in this Lease.</P>

<P>C.&#9;Unless otherwise allowed by the Court and until such time as the Lease is assumed or rejected, the Trustee or Debtor-In-
Possession shall timely perform all the monetary and non-monetary obligations under this Lease which arise after the bankruptcy
filing, including, without limitation, the payment of Fixed Rent and such other Additional Rent charges payable hereunder.</P>

<P>D.&#9;The rights, remedies and liabilities of Landlord and Tenant set forth in this Section 21.1 shall be in addition to those
which may now or hereafter be accorded, or imposed upon, Landlord and Tenant by the Code.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;21.2 &#9;<B>Holdover. </B>Upon termination of the Lease or expiration of the term hereof, if Tenant retains possession of the
Premises without Landlord's written consent first had and obtained, then Tenant's possession shall be deemed a tenancy at
sufferance, and Landlord may bring an action for possession or detainer at any time thereafter.  If Tenant holds possession of the
Premises after the term of this Lease with Landlord's consent, Tenant shall become a tenant from month to month upon the terms and
conditions as provided in this Lease except that Base Rent shall equal one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Rent due during
the last year of the Lease Term, payable in advance on or before the first day of each month.  All options if any, granted under the
terms of this Lease shall be deemed terminated and be of no effect during said month to month tenancy.  Tenant shall continue in
possession until such tenancy shall be terminated by either Landlord or Tenant giving written notice of termination to the other
party at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>22.&#9;<B>Landlord's Default</B>.  Upon any default by Landlord under this Lease, Tenant shall provide Landlord with written
notice of such default and a reasonable time period in which to cure such default.  </P>

<P>23.&#9;<B>Parking</B>.  Tenant shall have the right during the Lease Term to use, on a non-exclusive basis, two hundred and
seventy-three  (273) spaces within the parking facilities situated within the Common Areas. Tenant shall have the right to park on
the undeveloped land owned by Landlord which is adjacent to the Building, as designated in <B>Exhibit &quot;C&quot;</B> attached
hereto, provided that Tenant pays for all costs associated with acquiring access to and creating a surface parking area on the
undeveloped land described in <B>Exhibit &quot;C&quot;</B>, including, without limitation, all costs of City of Fremont permits and
meeting permit conditions, paving, landscaping, bridge construction, and acquisition of needed right-of-ways and access. Exhibit C
parking area is exclusive to Avanex use.</P>

<P>24.&#9;<B>Sale of Premises</B>.  In the event of any sale of the Premises by Landlord, Landlord shall be, without any further act
or acknowledgment on the part of Landlord or Tenant, entirely released from all liability under any and all of its covenants and
obligations contained in or derived from this Lease or arising out of any act, occurrence or omission occurring after the
consummation of such sale.  The purchaser at such sale or any subsequent sale of the Premises shall be deemed, without any further
agreement between the parties or their successors in interest or between the parties and any such purchaser, to have assumed and
agreed to carry out any and all of the covenants and obligations of Landlord under this Lease. Unless a successor to the Landlord's
interest under this Lease has received the Cash Deposit portion of security deposit or such successor has not received the Cash
Deposit but does agree, for the benefit of Tenant, to return that portion of the Cash Deposit to which Tenant may be entitled
pursuant to this Lease, then Tenant shall be entitled to offset against the Base Rent due for the last month of the Lease term that
portion of the Cash Deposit to which Tenant may otherwise be entitled. The foregoing offset, to the extent applicable, shall only be
offset against portions of the Base Rent due for the last month of the Lease Term at the time such Base Rent is due and payable and
shall in no event be used to offset Base Rent for any other month of the Lease Term and/or against any other Rents which become due
and payable under this Lease. </P>

<P>25.&#9;<B>Waiver</B>.  No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy of either party on any default by the other
party shall impair such a right or remedy or be construed as a waiver.  The subsequent acceptance of Rents by Landlord or payments
by Tenant after breach by the payee of any covenant or term of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach, other than a
waiver of timely payment for the particular payment involved, and shall not prevent the aggrieved party from maintaining any action
based on such breach (including an unlawful detainer action, if applicable).  No payment by a party or receipt by the other party of
a lesser amount than the Rent and other sums due hereunder shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest Rent or other
sums due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and
satisfaction.  A party may accept such check or payment without prejudice to its right to recover the balance of such Rent or other
sum or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease.  The waiver by a party of any breach of any term of this Lease shall not be
deemed a waiver of such term or of any subsequent breach thereof.</P>

<P>26.&#9;<B>Casualty Damage</B>.  If the Premises or any part thereof shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Tenant shall give
prompt written notice thereof to Landlord.  In case the Building or the Premises shall be damaged by fire or other casualty (a) such
that more than thirty percent (30%) reconstruction of the Building or the Premises is required, as determined by Landlord, or (b)
regardless of the extent of damage, such damage is either uninsured or the insurance proceeds are unavailable or insufficient for
Landlord to restore the Building or the Premises, Landlord may elect to either terminate this Lease or restore the Building or the
Premises.  In all other cases, Landlord shall promptly commence reconstruction repair subject to this Section&nbsp;26.  If Landlord
elects to terminate the Lease, the estate created hereby shall terminate forty-five (45) days following the date of damage, and Base
Rent due hereunder shall be abated as of the date of such damage.  If Landlord elects to repair and restore the Building or the
Premises, then Landlord shall proceed with reasonable diligence to restore the Building or the Premises (except Landlord shall not
be responsible for delays outside of its control) to substantially the same condition existing immediately prior to the casualty.
If Landlord is required to make any repairs or restorations pursuant to this Section&nbsp;26, Landlord shall not be required to
spend for such repairs or restoration an amount in excess of the insurance proceeds actually received by Landlord as a result of the
casualty.  If Landlord elects to repair or restore the Building or the Premises, then Tenant, within thirty (30) days after the date
the damage occurred, may request in writing from Landlord an estimate of the time required to repair or restore the Building or the
Premises.  Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's reasonable estimate of the time for restoration or repair. If a casualty
damages more than forty percent (40%) of the manufacturing area within the Premises and, as a result thereof, Tenant is not able to
conduct its manufacturing operations in any portion of the Premises, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease if
Landlord estimates that the Premises cannot be restored within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date the damage occurred.
Tenant shall exercise (if at all) the aforesaid right to terminate within five (5) business days from receipt of Landlord's
estimate, which termination shall be effective as of the date the damage occurred.  Landlord shall not be liable for any
inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, injury to the business of Tenant, loss of use of any part of the Premises by Tenant or loss of
Tenant's personal property resulting in any way from such damage or the restoration thereof, except that, during any restoration,
Landlord shall allow Tenant a fair diminution of Base Rent during the time and to the extent the Premises are unfit for occupancy.
</P>

<P>&#9;It is the intent of the parties hereto that the original Tenant Improvements will be covered by the casualty insurance
carried by Landlord on the Building and that, in the event of a casualty where Landlord elects or its otherwise required to restore
or repair, Landlord will restore or repair such improvements to the extent of insurance proceeds which are actually available to
Landlord for such purpose; provided, however, in no event shall Landlord be required to rebuild, repair or replace any part of   any
Alterations or other improvements constructed by, or of behalf of, Tenant or any of Tenant's furniture, furnishings or fixtures and
equipment except to the extent that Landlord actually receives insurance proceeds with respect to the damage of such property
(Tenant acknowledges that Landlord is under no obligation to maintain insurance covering such property and that neither Landlord nor
any of its representatives have made any representations or warranties to Tenant that Landlord intends to maintain any insurance
covering such property).  Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Sections&nbsp;1932(2.), 1933(4.), 1941 and 1942 of the California
Civil Code.</P>

<P>Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease if (a) the damage to the Premises occurs during the last year of
the term of this Lease, and (b) it is estimated by Landlord that the necessary repairs will take more than ninety&nbsp;(90) days
from the date of the damage.</P>

<P>27.<B>&#9;Condemnation</B>.  If thirty percent (30%) or more of the Land or fifteen percent (15%) or more of the Premises is
taken for any public or quasi-public purpose of any lawful governmental power or authority, by exercise of the right of
appropriation, reverse condemnation, condemnation or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking, Tenant or Landlord may, at its
sole option, terminate this Lease as of the effective date of such taking.  Tenant shall not assert any claim against Landlord or
the taking authority for any compensation because of such taking, and Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire amount of any
award without deduction for any estate of interest of Tenant; provided, Tenant shall be entitled to any portion of an award
separately designated as compensation to Tenant for moving expenses and/or loss of goodwill.  If less than thirty percent (30%) of
the Land and/or less than fifteen percent (15%) of the Premises is taken, Landlord shall, if necessary, promptly proceed to restore
the Premises and the Common Areas to substantially its same condition prior to such partial taking, allowing for the reasonable
effects of such taking, and a proportionate allowance shall be made to Tenant for the Rent corresponding to the time during which,
and to the part of the Premises of which, Tenant is deprived on account of such taking and restoration.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Landlord shall not be required to expend funds in connection with the restoration of the Premises in excess of
compensation actually received by Landlord from the condemning authority.</P>

member banks under Sections&nbsp;13 and 13(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, as now in effect or hereafter from time to time amended,
not to exceed the maximum rate allowable by law.  The accrual and/or acceptance of any interest shall not constitute a waiver of
Tenant's default with respect to any overdue amount, nor prevent Landlord from exercising any of Landlord's other rights or
remedies.</P>

<P>&#9;28.9&#9;<B>Notices</B> .  All notices and demands required to be sent to Landlord or Tenant under the terms of this Lease
