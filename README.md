# TCLP Provocatype: Clause Discovery Prototype

This prototype explores a design hypothesis for helping lawyers and contract drafters identify the most relevant and impactful climate-aligned clauses.

## Hypothesis

> **If users are given a tool that analyses the language of their contract, suggests relevant clauses, and ranks these based on potential emissions reductions, then they will use more impactful climate-aligned clauses compared to searching manually and feel more confident that they have identified the most relevant and effective clause for their context.**

This provocatype tests whether **automated analysis and ranking** can shift behaviour from manual searching to guided clause adoption, increasing both **impact** and **confidence**.

## How It Works

- This prototype is a **simulation of an AI model** that analyses contracts and recommends relevant clauses.  
- The underlying model and approach are documented in [TCLP’s `risk_id` repository](https://github.com/chancery-lane-project/risk_id).  
- The text outputs in these static HTML pages are **real results** generated by that model.  
- **index.htm** acts as the entry point for the simulation.  
- **contract-report-[n].htm** represent different example outputs from the model:  
  - Each shows suggested TCLP clauses linked to the analysed contract text.  
  - Clauses are ranked by their **potential emissions reduction impact**.  
  - The reasoning is displayed to build user trust and confidence in the suggestions.  

## Purpose

This is a **provocatype**:  
- Not a finished product, but a stimulus for testing assumptions.  
- Used in user research sessions to provoke reactions, gather feedback, and validate or invalidate the hypothesis.  
- Helps us learn whether users prefer guided, ranked clause suggestions over manual search.  

## Next Steps

- Test with legal practitioners and in-house teams.  
- Measure whether confidence, relevance, and adoption increase compared to manual browsing of TCLP’s clause library.  
- Decide whether to develop this into a functional tool that integrates with contract drafting workflows.  

## For Testers

1. Download and unzip the prototype folder.  
2. Open **index.htm** in your web browser (double-click should work on most systems).  
3. Explore the interface and follow the prompts.  
4. View the different **contract report** pages (`contract-report-1.htm` to `contract-report-4.htm`). Each shows:  
   - Suggested climate-aligned clauses.  
   - A ranking of clauses by potential emissions reduction.  
   - Explanations of why each clause is relevant.  
5. Share your feedback on:  
   - Whether the suggestions feel relevant and useful.  
   - How confident you feel in the recommendations compared to manual searching.  
   - What would make the tool more practical for your work.
